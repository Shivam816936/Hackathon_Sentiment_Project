0,"Expensive Junk . This product consists of a piece of thin flexible insulating material, adhesive backed velcro and white electrical tape.Problems:1. Instructions are three pictures with little more information.2. Velcro was all crumpled as received and was stronger than the adhesive. When i tried to disengage the velcro both pieces came off and the paint from the ceiling.3. White electrical tape was horrible... cheap, narrow and it fell off in less than 1 hour.4. The price is a ripoff.I am building my own which is easier to use, cheaper, more attractive, and higher r-value. I am surprised Amazon even lists this junk."
0,"Toast too dark . Even on the lowest setting, the toast is too dark for my liking. Also, the on light stays lit so you have to unplug it to avoid wasting electricity. Not the quality I expected from Cuisinart."
1,Excellent imagery...dumbed down story . I enjoyed this disc. The video is stunning. I agree with others that the story is very dumbed down and takes a childish approach. It actually seems like its a little one sided and VERY pro-environmental. Nevertheless its enjoyable. I would say however that the Amazon WMV HD disc is a better story and has better and sharper images and more interesting things to look at.
0,"Are we pretending everyone is married? . The authors pretend that parents neither die nor divorce. Insisting the marriage is the rock upon which all else (behavior, well-being of the child) is built, they send a clear message to non-traditional households: this book is for people who play the game of life our way only, and everyone else can suffer the bad behavior they deserve to."
0,"Not worth your time . Might as well just use a knife, this product holds next to nothing. I found it to be a useless product."
0,"Book reads like written for grade schoolers . I think that the whole aspect of hitting the road and going on tour with a band is just about the coolest thing that a person can do. Thus, this book seemed like the perfect read for someone like me. But when I got the book I was dissapointed in the fact that it seems like the author took five or six stories from the 'The Babysiters Club' or some other book for young kids, rewrote them to include drug and music references, and than sold it. The writing is just not very good and the stories are all lame. A girl's mother realizes her 16 year old daughter is right about being on tour, a girl runs from the cops and gets away, a ticket is fake, ect. Those in themselves aren't even that bad but the way he writes makes it a boring read."
0,"Jeanne de Florette & Manon of the Springs . I saw these movies originally in the theater, loved both and ordered them because I wanted to have it in my collection. I ordered it twice and neither of the DVDs worked. I would think you would check your merchandise before sending it out. I am so disappointed and can't believe that you could send out two defective DVDs and had not solved the problem after the first one plus some of the complaints I have read in the reviews. I am rating this with one star because of the quality of the DVD, not the films.Colleen"
0,"Theater Projector Ceiling Mount . Would not fit my new Optima HD20 projector -- as projectors get smaller the mounting holes get closer together -- this mount had four arms and the projector had three -- the mount had arms that would not get short enough to reach the three projector holes -- for larger projectors may work better, but for mine would not recommend -- returning it was very easy and the company representatives very helpful -- so if you get it and it doesn't work, the company is easy to work with --"
1,"This import is sooooooooooo good . This is a great cd!!!!!!!!! It is the normal oops! cd plus three cool new songs. Also there are lots of added extras that are inhansed on the cd, for example you get the lucky video, a fact file, and a britney unscrambler!!!!! The three bonus tracks are really nice but I wish that they could have been a little more up tempo. Just to clear something up it says in the discription that there is an exclusive oops preformance but there isn't!"
0,"Garbage . The handle broke clean off after TWO WEEKS. Not the plastic part, actually at the weld where the metal meets the pan. Wasn't overheated, wasn't abused, used 4 times and broke."
1,"Amazing, Fascinating . This was a stunning book. Well written, packed with fascinating detail, I wish I had ten more like it to turn to. Anyone looking for an inside view of a part of China's history would do well to pick up this book. It was a wonderful read."
0,"Not great . This book just gives you the basics unfortunately. Was not very helpful, I would suggest just doing research on the interweb instead."
0,superficial fluff . This book does not convey much of anything. Save your time and money. Read Searching for Bobby Fischer. The details and honesty are lacking in this made for MTV summary of kindergartener makes good.
1,"Great Album - some serious stuff . First off, I've bought ALL of Tonis other albums. This one took me three listenings to really get to like it. When I found out that it was about a child being born and how her life progressed, I found the work all the more interesting. Some of the songs really stick in your mind. If you see the Album as a story (of a girls life) it makes the Album much more interesting than just listening to the album song by song.Pink Floyd used to do this, have an album which was a theme or story, like The Wall album.I took the CD out of my colection after not listening to it for about 5 months, and have been playing it in my car on the way to work and home for over a week now.It's GREAT. And I'm not a female by the way.Nice ALbum. If you like Tonis other works,.....GET IT."
1,"good quality, but high shipping charge . the scratch resistant screen guard protector is fit perfectly on the screen of HTC cingular 8125. Quality of the screen guard protector is very good. only negative point is high shipping charge. it cost me $4.99 as shipping for buying this item which cost $ 3.49 amazon has to reduce the shipping charge, or reduce the shipping charge for combined items. any way best buy."
0,Couldn't even finish it. . I couldn't even finish the book. I got about half way through and realized I wasn't paying attention and didn't care. Nothing like Harry Potter - not fun at all. I can't recommend this at all!
1,Great choice for bedtime or anytime! . We were given this book as a shower gift before our kids were born and I was somewhat skeptical but it has turned out to be a favorite. Our daughter loves to name the animals and their sounds and has learned her colours from these wonderful books. The pictures are just right as is the wonderful text that is just enough repetition that she 'gets it' to participate with the reading. A great asset to your children's library... or shower gift for those people who have everything already!
1,"Fun for all ages! . Having received this video as a gift, we watched it as a family, accompanied by a lot of laughter and ""I didn't know that"". The kids managed to show this to most of their friends, the youngest even taking it to school where his 1st grade teacher used it as a part of her unit on Careers.The video is an overall winner. Anyone, any age, will enjoy the playful and informative story and all will come away with a greater understanding and respect for both the lobster and the lobsterman. BUY IT!"
1,Contemplating Marriage...a must read. . This book is used by many marriage counselors. But I believe if you are getting married this book should be required reading. It provides true insight to what makes us tick and how to keep the fire burning bright which should be every expecting to be couple's heart desire.
1,"Ran the Stoplight? . Listened to this CD closely for the first time in a while. I've forgotten how outstanding this CD is. While I have not heard Pure, I have ordered it hoping it that will be anything close to this CD - and hopefully far away from Dead Inside which is a whole different planet. Great vocals, great music, great lyrics, it has it all."
1,"Excelente Compilación de lo mejor de Caifanes . Debido a los otros comentarios al respecto de este disco quiero aclarar que Caifanes NO es lo mismo que Jaguares. Son dos grupos diferentes ya que en Caifanes la guitarra estaba en primer plano. El unico pero que le pongo a este CD es que solo incluyeron 2 canciones del MTV Unplugged. Me hubiera gustado que incluyeran todo el MTV unplugged en el segundo disco. Las guitarras de Marcovich se aprecian mas en las versiones en vivo ya que existe la certeza de que no hay ""overdubbing"" (Regrabaciones). Un buen disco para empezar. Estoy seguro que si este es el primer disco de Caifanes que se adquiere pronto nacera la curiosidad por conocer las canciones que no se incluyen de los otros discos."
0,Not prepared as an ebook . This book has two stories writen at the same time. In the original pbook format one story was written in left pages and the other in the right pages. But this is all lost in the Kindle and its very complicated to follow the story. I can not uderestand how they dare to sell a product not propared to be used properlly by its readers.
0,"Thanks for the 1960s home movie Ken Burns . The documentary is typical Ken Burns... interesting, but a little meandering at times.The real shame of this version is the grainy video that is painfully apparent on a large HD display. Burns' panned still images are crystal clear showing every blemish and fold of the old photographs but his shots of the majestic scenery in the parks are marred by his poor choice of camera and film. I will say the soundtrack is fairly well done even if Peter Coyote (narrator) is a little dry.Do not bother with the blu ray version, you will not get anything more than the standard DVD version with this series."
0,"not nearly as good as the first series . This book is nowhere near as good as the the first series! It SERIOSLY LACKS EXEMENT!In other words don't buy it, if you really want to read it, get it from the libray. I would not recomend it to anybody."
1,"HARRISON FORD AT HIS VERY BEST! WITNESS RULES! . ""WITNESS"" is about Ford and an Amish boy who witnesses a murder. Now, the Amish don't beleive in killing and guns - and to have their child see that sort of stuff is just terrible. Now, men who were involved in the murder are out to murder THE AMISH BOY! Suspenseful and red - blooded, ""WITNESS"" is an awsome film! I loved it and I bet anyone will, too! ENJOY!"
1,"Excellently Drawn Characters . Nina's characters are complex and drawn well, it is evident that she took some time to think about her character's motivations. If I were a writer I might have written the ending differently, but that is okay, my book club talked about this one for awhile. A good exploration of the line between admiring someone and stalking and a bold exploration of the dark side of behavior. If you are looked for a well plotted, interesting story, this is for you. It is not one of those books with lots of sex and no plot as you might think at first. I was pleasantly surprised and look forward to whatever Ms. Foxx has up her sleeve next."
1,it's nice . I've saved a lot of space by hanging my shoes up with this. For heavier shoes you have to use more than one hanger though
1,"One of the best albums I've owned. . A few years back my father got me hooked on this album. It was the first cd I ever owned. An ex-girlfriend liked it so much that after we broke up she declared that cd was not coming with me.I couldn't blame her. The mix of blues and spirituals with Cooder's unique playing makes this one the most intesting albums I own. The medley of ""Feeling Good"" and ""Fool for a Cigarette"" is one of my favorites as well as balads like ""Mexican Divorce"" and ""Jesus on the Main Line"".The album also has some songs that keep it from taking itself too seriously. The song ""If Walls Could Talk"" has a catchy riff and great words.Cooder's great acoustic style shines through on what was a break-through album of the time and holds up years later. I always hear something that I missed on previous listenings.Although you don't need to be a guitar player to appreciate this album, every acoustic player should hear the fine guitar work. Enjoy!"
1,Great for making dough . I ordered this bread machine for a vacation home that we own. I have a Cuisinart at my year-round home and it just has too many bells and whistles that I never use - and cost a lot more. The Sunbeam makes a great dough and was a great price.
0,"Mac Owners Beware . My wife purchased a Rocket ebook for me for Christmas. She started here at Amazon. She carefully checked the Rocket web site as well, and spoke to the folks that make the Rocket. She was assured that everything required to use the Rocket with a Mac was included. Wrong! Any Mac currently being made or made during the past year or so requires a Keyspan connector between the e-book and the Mac USB slot. This costs $80. It is not mentioned in any documentation that comes with the ebook. It took me more than an hour to get through to the company. At first they responded by saying it was at their Website and/or in the FAQ section, but we ""went to their Web site together"" while I was on the phone, and they reluctantly conceded that they had mislead the public. The company does literature. Guide provided on the ebook. Regardless of how much I may eventually enjoy this toy, I'll never develop a high regard for NuvoMedia, which makes the Rocket ebook."
0,"a disaster one month at a time . Upon receipt it was dead, after a mixture of e-mailes and phone calls it was determined I needed to use 2 USB cables to power the drive. Since I only have 2 on my laptop, I cant print from the drive. after transfering 10 gig of pictures and 13 gig of mp3's the unit failed the next month. Again emails and phone calls determined my laptop did not have enough power to run the drive. The solution was an AC adapter.....great for a ""portable USB drive"" They said an AC adaptor would be sent...no adapter after 4 weeks now. I tried the drive on 4 other DESKTOPS, plenty of USB power, but no luck. I have lost so much information, pictures, and music and now no emails refering to my ""service number"" are being answered at all.A total lack of customer servive AND knolage of their own product. Think long and hard before dealing with Iogear!!"
0,"Junk . I just got my DVD in today and I tried to watch it but there seems to be nothing on both discs, I have tried it in my DVD player and my computer, nothing is on both discs, nothing will load, I got robbed.If there were something on both discs, i'd give it a high rating, but for now, all i'll give is one star."
1,It is fun and a nice car . It is a nice car - better than a already made car - your son will have fun assemble it will even do some changes and when he finish he can continue playing as if it were a standard car.
0,"Robbery . This is a horrible disc, all of the songs, save one or two, have been reworked. If your looking for a cd to hear bygone favorites, as they were originally done, this is not the disc."
1,Definitely works . Have used this and it definitely gets u going to the potty!! Bye bye water weight! I just don't like that it has to steep for a while...I am impatient.
1,Excellent . All of James Patterson's books (Women's Murder Club) have kept me in suspense. I would be glad to say that it have been a thrill to read them
1,Everyone needs to let it go! . I'm sick of everyone saying Ashlee has no talent. If she had no talent she wouldn't have a record deal. She is only 19 and talks about 19 year old things. People seem to forget that she has been on tv for 2 years and that is why people already know her. I appreciate her music b/c it is her music. She's more than many musicians today-she's writing the lyrics rather than singing other people's songs. The album is good. Quit putting her down and appreciate her for her hard work! She sings a lot better than other musicians you all like!
0,"Not even ok. . I'm a pilot, and I'm giving up on this product. I've been trying to use it, calibrate it, get it to respond somewhat close to the way a real aircraft responds, and it just doesn't work. It is possible I'm doing something wrong, but it should not take several hours of trying to figure out the right way. I've reduced sensitivity to zero and it still won't respond realistically."
0,"One Minute to Zero . Movie had a great story, but filming methods of that time was not that great. I enjoyed the movie mostly because I had met the stars when they were in Colorado Springs during the filming of some of the movie.I purchased this movie from Amazon."
1,Just like when I was a kid! . I bought this for my daughter when she was almost 2yrs. and she loved it from the start. The music is a little annoying but that is my problem not hers. She has stood on top of it and it has been dropped down the stairs and it still works fine!I would definalty reccomend this toy!
0,Disappointed: . I was disappointed with this book. Since it said Hallelujah on the cover I though it was raw food recipes. I will be giving it away for a gift when I need something for a gift the next time.This book should of never been put with the Hallelujah diet book.
0,"This Muse is a slumber! . Actually, I thought I had ordered the CD of the TV show. Unfortunately, it wasn't. Amazom staff admitted that the pics on the sell page were misleading. We've listened and it's not worth much. Curious how a TV sound track can be so engaging and another CD so trite and shallow. Buyer beware."
0,"Not necessary. . I bought this neck strap WITH my camera, thinking I would be insane not to have a strap to put around my neck.I learned, however, that it really isn't necessary. The Elphs are so tiny that they EASILY fit into your pocket. The other option is to wind the included wrist strap around your wrist. They're so lightweight that you barely notice they're there."
0,"Men with Brooms . If you love the sport of curling, do not watch this movie! The acting is just okay. Don't let your kids watch this movie as there is a lot of profanity in it. The movie isn't awful, but it isn't good either. The curling action is not realistic."
1,"Works great for me . After my last Panasonic Shaver mysteriously disappeared when I moved across the country, I decided to try this one, since the price was so cheap I wouldn't be kicking myself if the other shaver is rediscovered in a moving box somewhere. I have been very pleased with it, and love shaving in the shower with it. Like others, I have found that the neck area requires a little more attention and a few extra passes to get the job done, but well worth it for a close shave with no bleeding. It took over a month for the product to be delivered from Amazon, since they were out of stock when I ordered."
0,"Item doen't work . This UPS never worked from day one when I pluged it up.The lcd display only comes on when it's working off the battery,and I cant get it to charge the battery because it seems like its not seeing the power source it just doesn't work."
0,"Not for burning . Within 20 minutes these candles were completely melted and now my carpet is a mess. More for decoration and with that being the case, these candles are too expensive for what your getting."
1,"Lost . A friend gave me a copy of ""Dresden"" and I watched it many times before giving it back and ordering my own copy. I watched the movie several times for different reasons: 1. History, 2. View from the German side, 3. View from the British side, 4. Acting skills. I love the movie, am impressed with F. Woll's in the main role. I think some scenes were too Hollywood, loved the honesty of the script, not too much violence, but one can start to feel the horror of the bombings and being trapped in cellars and on the ground by the devastating fires. I was a mistake, a big one, History was destroyed as it often is in wars. Did the Germans deserve this so much emotionally human reaction? Yes and No. Not only the Germans or the people of Dresden lost a jewel."
0,"LAME . I agree with the kids review below. This album along with all of their others is garbage. They just keep putting out the same album over and over.Do you really think in 10, 20, even 30 years, people are going to be playing Nickelback CDs and saying, ""Wow they were a great band""? Who goes around blasting Creed, Poison, Cinderella, Ratt, or C&C; Music Factory? This band will be forgotten just like these others.It's textbook rock ballad garbage with no thought or feeling put into the song writing. They have found a formula that somehow sells records and so they've stuck with it. Watch their live performances with Chad's gay permed haircut. Someone should take their instruments away so they won't poison rock music anymore."
1,"Great movie! . This is the epitome of a ""B"" western movie, but it's hilarious! Andy Griffith, Tom Berrenger, Marilou Henner and Selma Ward--all of them did a great job on this!"
1,"Yummy! . These are individually wrapped and there are approximately 15 cookies in each box. They have a nice flavor and are fresh and crispy. The fortunes are standard fortune cookie fare. Very few of these were broken during shipping. I definitely recommend these if you like fortune cookies. They are a low-calorie, low-fat snack. Yummy!"
1,"Great speaker package for the money! . Polk Audio RM6750 5.1 Channel Home Theater Speaker System, Black FinishI have been using this speaker system for about a year with a Sony STR-DG810. I am very pleased with the performance of this package especially at the price point. My friends and family have all been impressed remarking that the system sounds like a movie theater. Bass from sub-woofer is deep and powerful and the center speaker reproduces dialoge beautifully. What is also nice, Polk sells seperate surround speakers so I can make a 6.1 system since my Sony receiver has that capability. Don't worry if you are thinking about RM6750, I have enjoyed mine from the start!"
0,"misleading specs . VA 1/2 inch rotaty files and rasps are not 1/2 inch in diameter. They can be up to 1/16 smaller depending on product number. ie: 16671 is labeled 12.7 mm, yet VA's spec is 12.0 mm, and 16674 is labeled 12.7 mm, yet VA's spec is 11.6 mm"
1,"kfm . I first saw Kentucky Fried Movie when I was 17 years old. I am now 51. A friend of mine mentioned a line from the movie and it was so funny that I went online to buy this movie to show my son and also to see it again with my friends now. It is made up of little skits that are all funny. Maybe a little silly also, but still a good movie to hang out and watch."
1,"Funkin amazing and out there . Like Strayhorn and the Duke, Gil really found someone he could bounce off in the shape of Brian Jackson. His earlier stuff is pure gold, but very droney sometimes... BUT THIS!!!This I never tire of. The songs still sound so vibrant and fresh.The live version of 'home is where the hatred is' has been sampled by masters @ work, and is a muso's dream to get into.'Hello Sunday hello road is one of the grooviest tracks around, and you just can fail to move along and understand the message of 'It's your world.' My Mum used to have the LP, Secrets, with the cats face on the cover. Angel dust is a spacey reincarnation of whats it's like to trip out on the stuff, and the lyrics to showbusiness are more relevent today than ever before.This is one of the best and most valuble compilations of Gils to come out, and is an essential purchase for and funkster and poet."
1,"Great Art, Great Action . Jedis are great and all, but I really enjoy the war aspect of this series. Vol 1 was good, Vol 2 started really picking up in the last section, and Vol 3 really gets to it--War! Its the volumes like this one that make me wish they had a series devoted to Clone Troopers, Republic Commandos, and ARCs (esp Alpha). Good inking and artwork. Straight-forward plot, almost near constant action, and it was good to see the Republic actually defeated here. Nice character development for Anakin. This volume has been my favorite so far...looking forward to getting Vol 4."
0,"Good for stretching, not to get a workout. . I've been to yoga classes where you get more of a workout than this one. This is more like a stretching exercise. My complaint is a lot of the stretches seemed to repeat many times. The equipment required for use to follow the exercise like the block, straps are kinda specialised items you'd have to buy. I tried to substitue with items I can find at home like a step stool, and rope.For a real workout, I prefer the Perfect Pregnancy workout dvd with Karyne Steben."
0,"TERRIBLE ACTING . This movie could have been good, but the acting was SO bad I turned it off after 20 minutes (I can't even believe I watched it that long) I was hoping something would change, the plot was a good, but COULD not even get into any of the characters. I don't recommend this movie."
1,out standing . this item make's my bathroom look like you don't want to leave the room.i wish there were other item's to match the seat. thank you!
1,"Amazing first single!!! . The first single from this album is called ""Through the Rain"". It's like Old Mariah only even better. This is a beautiful ballad which has a similiar theme to ""Hero"" or ""Can't Take That Away"", but is even more incredible. If you liked ""old"" mariah, you will want this album. She does have rappers on it, but they aren't the main focus. It's such a beatiful song and I have heard soooooooooo many good things about this album ~ and not just from fans but from critics too! Go to her official site to listen to Through the Rain http://www.mariahcarey.com"
0,"Awkward and trite, too many cliches for me. . While the subject matter of ""The Last Dive"" is compeling enough to carry its own story line, the author's attempts to interject contrived dialogue is embarrasing and a deteriment to his otherwise skillfull writing. Chowdhury would have been well advised to simply tell the story and not try to animate it with guessed-at dialogue. I came away disliking the ""cowboy-like"" father and son diving team and their tragic demise came as no surprise. Chowdhury's techincal explanations and descrption of the history of the sport are very good. Unfortunately his fictionalizing of the varous conversations is more cartoon than clever."
0,"What a Pervert! . This was a horrible book!Anthony is a sadistic pedophiliac who had been ""watching [the heroine] from afar"". He had even gone so far as to have her tutored in a language he wanted her to speak.It sickened me that the character was made to fall in love with her rapist.""Love"" does not justify rape or whipping a woman or any of the other sick things in this book."
0,"Mitusmi Extrenal USB Floppy Drive . The unit itself seems to be a good unit. However... it is a terrible device for using in Windows 7 Pro. There are no drivers for it, and you can't not get customer support to answers to your correspondence, for it. So if your going to try to use it in Windows 7... for now, for get it."
1,"My dog's favorite toy by far! . I bought the duck for my 5 pound poodle and it became his favorite toy. The sound of the duck scared him though, but the great part is if they don't like it you can just remove it and they still love just the plush toy. It's perfect for even the smallest dogs and can easily be carried around and played with. The design makes it easy for small dogs to get their mouths around to pick up. I would not recommend this for very destructive dogs though as the limbs might get torn off."
0,"Romantic Rape? . I enjoy romance novels. I do not enjoy reading about a woman who is abducted, continually raped, impregnated, and then FALLS IN LOVE with her rapist. I kept reading hoping that he would get his just dessert. But he didn't. She falls in love with him and he gets ""reformed."" ????? The whole time all I could think was--this is called Stockholm Syndrome! I was horrified that this was considered a romance. The rape scenes were graphic and, in many cases, violent.Johanna Lindsey should be ashamed of herself for making rape romantic. It is horrible. DO NOT READ!!!"
0,"Did not live up to the hype; not even close. . I really was disappointed in this book. With all the hype I expected it to be filled with revolutionary ideas and recipes for totally green smoothies. There are a few interesting details such as the thought that our diet should more closely resemble chimps. Basically we should eat more greens. Other than that much of it is hard to believe. There is absolutely NO WAY all those people (first name only) were cured of illnesses by drinking one quart of green smoothies. Sorry... but NO WAY. Please, moles and warts just fell off.... That kind of claim is a total turn off. The recipes are plain old one cup of greens with fruit and ice. So basically eating one cup of spinach a day, ground up, will cure diabetes? Way over rated. I read it in one night and it is definitely not something I would want to keep as a reference for anything. Get it out of the library."
1,"It's the unthinkable! . The only reason that I am giving 4 stars is because the author did not list all the victims of Dr. SHipman's unsuspected reign of terror in Lancashire. In his long career, he probably killed at least 200 victims--men, women, children, for no apparent reason until he was stopped by the law. Sadly, I cannot stop thinking about all the victims who had dreams to see Israel, cruise, grow up, or old with their loved ones in Lancashire. Dr. Shipman was supposed to be respected and trusted with their lives; he killed his beloved patients without such motives at all. The book is an easy read unless you're trying to find out the victims and give them a proper memorial. This book is for those victims and their families! Maybe we can learn from what happened in Lancashire!"
0,"Love him but this a terrible movie . The characters never really fully develop and, it's a dark miserable story with people running, crying, screaming, at times you need to stop and say to yourself what's going on. I felt nothing for him as a character neither did I feel anything for any of them, I wasn't socked I was bored.It's OK to watch on an airplane ride so you can fall asleep...from 1 to 10 I give a 5"
0,"Great for baby bonding, bad for SIDS aspect. . I was very excited about this book, until my baby died of SIDS. I think it has some great info. on breastfeeding, etc., but the chapter on SIDS is simply incorrect.The author, like Dr. Sears, is a huge bed sharing advocate. The US Comsumer Product Safety Commission, just concluded a 8 year study that strongly advises against bed sharing to reduce SIDS. The American Academy of Pediactrics and US Public Health Svc. back up this study. Since our loss, it's important to me that the correct info. gets circulated. See the SIDS Alliance web page for more information about SIDS."
1,"Pedco Digital Ultrapod II . This is a really nice accessory for any photographer. It fully supports my ""tweener"" camera even while fully zoomed. It is extremely lightweight and durable. The strap is a great feature - I have strapped the tripod to railings, benches, tree branches, etc. It is easy to attach to my camera and has complete range of motion. I take it with me every time I grab my camera."
1,"Classic Soulful Cuts . this is a Compilation that you can share with your Love One or just chill to.the isley Brothers,Intruders,Sly&The Family Stone,Tyrone Davis,Gladys Knight&the Pips among others make this a very Soulful Collection."
1,"Very helpful. . I ordered this to accompany the Pimsleur Language Russian program, as Pimsleur, although very powerful for learning to speak, has little more than a pamphlet to teach you to read. So, I picked this up, and it is very handy. It has made the process of learning to read fairly easay and enjoyable.I would have rated this a 3, however, because you lose a LOT of the meat of the book if you don't have the audio recordings, which aren't included in the book. At least, they weren't with mine. However, I poked around online and found that they're available for download off this website:http://mllc.utsa.edu/troika/student/mp3.htmI don't know how long that site will be up, but if you intend to use this book to teach yourself to read and speak, those MP3s will be invaluable."
0,"Not as it looks! . Heart pendant does not look as pretty as in the picture, there's this gold topaz covering on both sides that totally ruins the look of the normal Swarovski crystal, in other words, no colors shine at all. Same thing in on other sites for like $1. Speedy delivery was the only positive."
1,"I LIKE IT!!! . I love the compactness of this waterpik. I had the larger one and this one is far more convenient. You don't have to invert the reservoir and the power of the jet is actually stronger than the bigger model. Granted, the smaller amount of liquid in the reservoir was a little disappointing, but I just keep another cup ready to refill it while I am still using the pik. It is definitely easy to use and, of course, that means it will be used more often and the check ups at the dentist attest to the positive impact it has. I most often use a salt & warm water solution and it works great."

It doesn't fit for anyone one at all, be it an amateur or an intermediate level crafter. Believe me, it's best for you to avoid buying this book. It's not worth your money and time reading."
0,"BAD BAD BAD!!!! . This CD IS TERRIBLE!!!! IF YOU'VE EVER SEEN THE COMMERCIAL FOR ""KIDS BOP"" ITS ALMOST THE SAME THING!!! NONE OF THE ORIGANAL ARTISTS!!! ALL DONE BY ""THE HIT CREW"" !!! THE TITLE OF THE PAGE SAYS ""VARIOUS ARTISTS"" WHICH MEANS MANY DIFFERENT ARTISTS AND IT WAS ALL ONE STUPID BAND CALLED ""THE HIT CREW""!!! DONT BUY IT!!! IT IS TERRIBLE!!!"
1,recorder book . Granddaughter is not very good at reading music so I hope this book will help guide her when she needs it.
0,"Huge letdown . I can't understand all of the good reviews for this film, which I found to be a huge disappointment. Bad performances, coupled with awful direction and hackneyed, cliched writing puts this on my list of films to avoid. The film obviously tried to capitalize on Muniz's rising star power among youngsters and families, but offered little substance for this film to endure. There is never an indication at what makes this dog so special. And it' hard to believe that only two dogs were used for Skip; his appearance changes quite frequently throughout the film.If you want a recent ""uplifting"" family film, opt for ""The Sandlot."""
0,"Bad Design . What a terrible accessory!- The strap that latches the case keeps getting on the way when trying to write.- The Palm V can't fit on the hotsynch craddle without removing the case. What a pain!- It adds quite a bit of builkiness to the Palm V, making it harder to carry it on a shirt or jacket pocket.I need to find an alternative somehow...I wish my original standard cover hadn't broken..."

0,"Thank god I got this from the library... . First the disclaimers: I only read the first 100 pages and I'm a pretty extreme left winger on social issues.I never imagined this book could be so awful. It is essentially a package to present mindless blathering on political issues and uses every canned cliche of the ""liberal media."" I couldn't finish it. I'm so irritated by this book I'm venting it out here rather than waiting a bit and crafting a more decent review.I really enjoyed the entire Ender series and generally have found OSC's other books at least passably readable. However, I seriously doubt I will ever consider picking up another of his books without first getting some glowing recommendations."

0,"The History of Morrisville as seen through the eyes of a pedophile. . This guy has been accused of molesting students. Something he forgot to mention in his history of the town.From the Burlington Free Press:""In the spring, (Superintendent) Wrend placed Bryer on administrative leave but never reported him to the Vermont Education Department for possible license suspension. In a letter, she threatened to seek suspension unless Bryer agreed to discuss leaving the district.He complied and signed an agreement guaranteeing him full pay during his three-month leave, a job reference and a promise from school officials to frame his departure in ""positive"" terms. In exchange, Bryer agreed to resign effective June 30 and not sue the district.He quickly found a teaching job in Colchester.""Read more: [...]This is how Morrisville has been dealing with these problems for decades. That would have made one hell of a chapter in his book."
0,"Mistico Mess . Cacaphony and melodic mush. This album was very disappointing. As a lover of fusion, jazz, rock, worldbeat....music in general, this album requires a lot of patience to feel where the musicians were going. It's a clashing discordant ball of disappointed listening. And I WANTED to like it!"
0,"Nice Features, poor quality sound. . This Apex seems to be a fine unit, except the sound quality on the DVD side is quite poor. Quality otherwise has been good, unlike some of the previous reviews. Have they improved these, or did I just get a good one?"
0,"DREADFUL!! . For those of you who rated this one highly, here's one of ....We have a bent lawyer who unknowingly has 2 CIA agents posing in his office. There are a multitude of hidden cameras filming the lawyer day and night and yet when he goes to the prison the CIA only put a mic in his briefcase which ... is supposed to be as big as a golf ball in this day and age. All the time reading it I was thinking, why haven't they wired him all over? A team of crack CIA operatives are watching this pathetic drunk and yet he eludes him - but still ... for some unfathomable reason. while the real 'crooks' somehow don't get knocked off by the CIA and in the bargain get 2 million dollars each. It's bloody rubbish!!! And childish. In fact, the plot would insult a 12 year old.No star. Dreadful!!"
0,"Do not buy this DVD under any circumstances. . The movie is one of the all-time best horror films ever made. This DVD is a shining example of why you should do progressive transfers. Awful hazy non-progressive transfer may be animorphic... but it's filled with every bad video artifact you can think of (ghosting, combing, it's awfully blurry too). Do yourself a favor and buy the Collector's Edition from amazon.co.uk. It has a much better transfer, DTS sound and cool extras. Skip this."
0,"Poor stalk, worse handle . One of my biggest requirements when buying an umbrella is that it be one of substance. The handle should be weighty, the stalk should be solid and able to withstand high winds.Unfortunately, this umbrella turned out not to have either of those qualities. The handle was quite small. Typically, a handle should at least be as long as my hand is wide. This handle was about half that, which provided for very poor grip in high wind situations. The stalk also felt like hollow aluminum, not confidence inspiring at all.I returned this umbrella, I would never buy it again."
0,"Absolute Garbage . There are many things wrong with this keyboard, in the first that it's a novel concept, and was directed to be a 'keyboard' marketed towards gamers. I fell for the advertising and spent the first few hours messing with the various configurations and being in awe of the keymapping, but in the end you are still left with a very sub-par product - a rubber dome based keyboard, with folding gimmick top half.It would constantly disconnect from the computer, the drivers had to be reinstalled for it to respond again, it didn't exactly 'work' during bootup other, which forced me to fetch an older keyboard and use that to install Windows..Overall a very shoddy product. If you want a solid gaming keyboard for your money that won't die on you every 15 minutes after two days of ownership, strongly consider a Das Keyboard. It's what I'm writing this review on right now, and I've owned it for more than a year, a long time after I've thrown away the worthless Zboard as well."
1,"Great product . Works exactly as stated, you can also you the cord to connect directly to your PC which give it multiple purposes which is great in any product."
1,"Essential utility . I use this on a Jornada 525, and I must say you really need that if you want to avoid scrapes on you handheld.But it is not so easy to assemble without making fngerprints on the display (I started using gloves for that). Also the instruction are not so clear. There would be some words helpful.And they are a little to expensive for my taste."
0,"Paxil Lovers . Music for the paxil overdosed and misguided. A little talent in the drum department does not mean this band is progressive. After I heard this I thought I needed paxil. I honestly cannot believe King Crimson opened for this garbage. I guess they thought they could ride the coattails of this popular band. Yes, millions can be wrong including pedroza, daniel aka pebozo."
0,"Mind numbingly mindless . After 3 hours of playing this game my brain went into shut down mode, kinda like from staring at a wall for 3 hours. Belive me this game is just pretty, and if you like killing things mind-lessly then, by all means play this game! The Maximum IQ you can have to enjoy this game is 125. If your IQ is higher than 125, then you will not like it in most cases."
1,For Movie Lovers . I love this game. I play it with my family all the time. Since we watch alot of movies together we have alot of fun playing. Some of the questions are really challenging so it makes us think harder. Now we pay closer attention to the movies we watch so we'll be better the next time we play Movie Mania. It's really a fun game!
0,The Sex Pistols . Sex PistolsThe recording is rough but ok if your a Sex Pistols fan. The packaging is far greater than the quality of the CD inside. Recommended for the experienced ear of a true Sex Pistols fan.
1,Great for the times a computer is ineffective . This product is complete and easy to use.There are times when a computer search just doesn't meet my needs.This product allows me to look up verses by content without fail.
0,"OK Change From Metal Brushes . These have a very different feel from the metal brushes I have used, but they have some practical advantages.One minor downside on this particular set was that the end caps came off in my hands as soon as I started playing. They were very poorly glued on, but remounting with more and better glue solved this problem. I did not experience this with another set I bought."
0,"This man's retarded - and so is anyone who gave this more than a 1-star... . Obviously, you all have no life to speak of...I would've given it a lower rating (like a MINUS 3-star!), but I couldn't find it!"
1,"Fabulous tales with a twist . I first read ""The Lottery"" in high school and it has stayed with me ever since. I bought this book for the title story, and it is the most powerful of the stories, though the others are also very entertaining. Hopefully it will also stay with you.Ms Jackson is a phenomenally talented writer. You know immediately that there is something wrong with the simple village lottery, and the suspense and horror builds with every word. That this can be achieved in the space of a short story is amazing - we have a very lttle time before we are faced with the shocking truth.""The Lottery"" is the finest short story of its genre, and stands alone as one of the greatest stories ever written. Shirley Jackson is a master, and her novels ""The Haunting of Hill House"" and ""We Have Always Lived in the Castle"" are also engrossing reads. But ""The Lottery""? Well, you will never forget the twist in the tale."
1,"Michael Swango, aka Killer . Good Book. Very Interesting. Michael Swango - guilty of all charges including murder. I am appalled by what he got away with in the medical field. I am appalled that the doctors and hospitals allowed him to get away with it, and they should have been the ones to 'blow the whistle' on him. Unbelievable! I didn't think this could ever happen in the United States and in the medical field."
1,"Nice . Pick holder. Will hold about 8-10 picks depending on the type of pick you prefer. Obviously thick picks will mean less storage, thin ones will mean more. Overall it is great for the boyfriend who is constantly losing his picks."
0,"CBS Screws Up Again With Producing DVDs . The only reason I give this box set one star is because I can't watch it EXCEPT on my computer. For 4 1/2 seasons' worth, I've enjoyed these episodes on my Dynex flat screen. But - and I've had this experience with several other CBS DVDs, for some reason there is some glitch in these DVD discs where they cannot play on my TV set. So BEWARE! I will not purchase another CBS set of DVDs unless I test them at the store first, which is, of course, impossible. I LOATHE playing DVDs on my computer, which I use for - dare I mention it - work.LET THE BUYER BEWARE. CBS IS GUILTY."
1,"amazing little speakers! . these speakers are wonderful! and adorable! my only gripe is that they're fairly lightweight and if the sound is up loud, they tend to rumble right off my shelf. and although i do wish they went a little louder, they're pretty stellar for the size and price."
1,"pretty good, hard at first . I bought this a while ago and im rather pleased with it. It works good as a cd player and it never has skipped on me. The mp3 cds can hold ver 100 songs and are VERY COOL!!!! un fortunatly, some of my mp3 files didn't play through the cd player, and some didnt even show up on the display. It is kind of difficult to make a cd and get it formatted right. Several of the cds i made didnt work at all, and it took several tries to get my first mp3 cd working, but once i did it was very usefull. The text search feature is kind of cool but i never use it. When u can get an mp3 cd to work it is very cool but it is kind of hard. RThe manual sucks. The cd player is kind of bulky so i wouldnt try jogging with it. but most mp3 cd players are pretty big. It gets scratched easily so watch out. but overall it is very good."
1,"perfect tool for students and teachers . the KKV (king, Keohane and Verba) is one the best tool for beginners in research for social, political, International Relations students or academics. it delivers advices and problems that researchers will come across at one moment of the research life. it also offers a good overview and critical analysis of what research is.the authors make sure the heavy subject that is reasearch in social sciences is not too heavy to read. the books approaches the different methodologies that research will have to chose.if not owned yet, it is in need to be buy and must belong the student private library."
0,"The IRA a feminist movement? Who knew? . This is an interesting read, but the basic premise (Ireland taken over by the Church with a capital C, women oppressed, the IRA to the rescue), doesn't ring true, and the rest suffers badly. A more socially aware future history of Ireland would be fabulous--I wish this had a little more flair to it."

0,"Another American Idol Miscalculation . There is absolutely nothing special about Carrie's voice. Carrie won American Idol because she is young, blonde and pretty. Period. Clearly, she was far from the best vocal in this year's competition. Her voice is extremely average. I predict she MIGHT have one more hit and then fade into the same obscurity that Ruben is in, and Fantasia is headed towards."
0,"You have a super computer ? buy, not don't buy!. . We buy that and we are thinking return, You can't see the software using a normal computer you have to buy first a super computer to run that. The Flight simulator 2004 is better running in a normal PC. you can't see all graphics and detail without a super machine.My machine is a Pentium M 1.7 Ghz 512 Ram, Toshiba Tecra and take 4 hour in the installation process, and 1 complete day to play the simulator.Don't do that to us microsoft please.............."
1,Good book . A great book. Highly recommended. If you are looking for a page turner this one will qualify! One of the better science fiction books I've read lately.
1,"L.O.D. - Def Squad . Keith Murray steps out for another dictionary rhyme book tales with another album entitled Enigma. He impressively both used a vocabulary to conversant with scholars and entertained his listeners with tales of adventure with titles like ""World Be Free"" and the heartfelt ""To My Mans"" featuring Dave Hollister. As he begins by antagonizing others on ""Intro"" it continues over to ""Call My Name"" as he dares any competition to contest. ""Dangerous Ground"" featuring 50 Grand is more upbeat than usual for Keith, but his ability to adapt nearly passes by. The highlight of this LP is ""What A Feelin'"" with its groovy, scale runs with the bass. ""Love L.O.D."" featuring 50 Grand & Kel-Vicious is a good display of patience and the tight knit of L.O.D. as the trio shows why they are the nicest in this profession. To close, Keith Murray's Enigma is lyrically fulfilling."
0,Zero stars is more like it! . This so called romance novel is nothing but 300 pages of a girl having her period and whining. Read only if you want to lose your lunch. The last chapter they finally have sex but then find out she was child molested. How does this ever get on the romance book list? Disappointment and waste of six bucks
1,"A decent phrase book, but no more. . I spoke Azeri relatively well once and decided to pick up this little book to revisit the language. Out of the limited amount of literature on the subject I chose this one on a hunch and it's nothing more than a phrase book for a tourist to get around. It does a good job of indroducing the most common expressions to an English speaker. Expect to find exact pronounciation of singlular words and 2-3 word phrases and expressions. Do not expect a textbook on the language :)"
1,"Lost and Found . For those of you unfamiliar with JSS,he has been around for many years with Yngwie,Talisman,and most recently Journey. He is a very talented,yet underrated vocalist. This is an extremely impressive effort that any fan of the Melodic Rock scene would be glad to own. Give it a listen. You will be glad that you did."
0,"NO . There's not much wrong with this film, but it has changed the way I watch films forever. Previously I had laughed at the misrepresentation of other peoples misery in films, its portrayal as not really being as bad as the sufferer says it is. I'm sure most of us have at some time or another laughed at the misfortunate medical circumstances of others as represented on film. But after seeing this film I now feel ashamed and angry at the effect that films can have on the way society thinks of and treats people.Jack Nicholson, if you're going to play a character suffering from obsessive compulsive disorder and phobias HAVE THE DECENCY TO RESEARCH THE CONDITION AND PUT SOME EFFORT INTO CONVEYING THE MISERY IT BRINGS, rather than just playing it half-heartedly for laughs."
1,"True Value Superstore Pelonis B-6A1 ceramic heater . The the Pelonis B-6A1 ceramic heater is an excellent product. The folks that own and operate True Value Superstores on Amazon.com are Top Quality people. I appreciate their effort to achieve customer satisfaction, and products at an exceptional price."
1,"Like nothing else... . except maybe Jeanette Winterson's ""Written on the Body."" I felt deeply pulled in by this novel, which unfolds slowly and bathes you in an incredibly intoxicating, emotional mist. It is highly erotic and engrossing, and one of the only well written and overtly bisexual works of fiction. The only failure here is the ending which becomes a little too melodramatic and (I think) untrue to at least one of the characters. But the quality of language, plot, and character are very, very high. I took it in while I was recovering from a break-up and the relationships in Searle's book were enough to distract me. I consider it my rebound (without the consequences). Please read this book."
0,"Failure to Entertain . This is one of those movies that you watch and then, within a few days, you forget about.Sarah Jessica Parker plays Paula, a ""launcher"" or something. Parents hire Paula to coax their adult children into leaving home and getting a place of their own. Sound stupid enough for you already?Paula is hired by the parents of Tripp (Matthew McConaughey) and the story is about how, during the course of her employment, she falls in love with him, and he with her. There are a very few laughs along the way.Some might call this a ""chick flick"" but my wife (who is a fan of Sarah Jessica Parker and ""Sex and the City"") didn't like it either."
1,"Possibly the best TV show ever . I just finished watching Six Feet Under on Bravo. All I can say is, thank God for Bravo replaying the series! I never watched it while it was on HBO but now that I have a DVR I made sure to DVR the entire series. I just watched the final episode last night. I cannot tell you how much this series touched me. It really gave me insights into both life and death. I grew to love the characters and could identify with a lot of things about them. They made me look at my own life in a new way.The final three episodes are the best three episodes of any TV show, ever. I seriously spent almost the entire last three episodes crying. They were so wonderful and I LOVED the ending of the very last episode. As stated by previous commenters, it was the best ending of a series EVER! I want to own this DVD set just so I can watch the last three episodes again and again. I highly recommend this DVD and the entire series!"
0,Material and cut questionable . I have worn Levis for years. This style does not fit in a similar fashion to previous 569's. The material also feels extremely thin and not as durable as their previous lines. I would not recommend these jeans.
1,shimmer bag . I have just received this bag today and I absolutely love it! The color is exactly as it appears on the website! It was the exact color I was looking for and it is beautiful!
1,"Difficult decision . Excellent! This really is a great collection of mixes. When I pop this one in my car, I find it hard to decide which one to start with. Here's me thinking: ""Let's see, I'll start with... the original version, NO WAIT! number three, NO TWO! FOUR, I meant FOUR! NO TWO!!!..."" No wonder I'm always late for work - I spend half my day dancing in the car. A must-have for those who like remixed k.d."
1,"AIR POLLUTION DESIGN . This book is an excellent choice for engineers trying to design and model air pollution control plants, equipment and processes.It also gives useful details on installation and operational costs."
1,"My children love this CD! . The best night time CD for infants, toddlers and young children. All my children listen to this when they fall asleep at night. I start playing this when they are infants and my 9 year old still falls asleep to this CD. It is very soothing."

0,"what the!!!??? . This cd is not good. I think that R Kelly could do way better. I bought this cd on hope that it would be some bomb @#$ R Kelly @&%!. When I got in my car and started listening to this mess I was disapointed. I'm a 25 yr old woman and this cd does not appeal to me at all. R Kelly is too old to be puttin mess like this out.I dont even think Usher would take this route. Best song on the cd is ""Imma flirt"".The song ""Same Girl"" is not tight. Usher should slap hisself for saying yes to the song. Note to R Kelly:Stop making songs with stupid induendos. It was tight at first but its stupid now. make a better cd next time."
0,"Skip it . Each chapter in the book shows making of another model, from beginning to end. Each model is of a German vehicle, and that's how the book got its title. All in all it seems just coincidental - the book would be no better or worse if it was not the case.The book is definitely targeted at beginners, and it does an OK job, but nothing more. Some advice seems questionable - for example preshading with a Sharpie; in my experience it'll seep from underneath any kind of paint.Overall the book was disappointing for me. It may be of some use for a beginner, but that's about it."
1,"Cool,Cool,Cool! . This is absolutely cool. I am overclocking Quad6600 from 2.4 to 3.6. And I am using this machine to simulate numerical analysis using parallelized program. With full power of all processors, the lowest fan speed is enough to control the temperature....Cool, Cool, Cool!"
1,Happy Music! . Raymond McLain is a master of playful bluegrass music. His genius play of strings makes this CD a gem. I can't help but smile when listening to it!
1,"There and back again . All London office worker Richard Mayhew tried to do that evening was help a damsel in distress, but he got more - way more - than he bargained for. Neil Gaiman has spun another magical mystery tour from the elements of the mythological quest paradigm. Underworlds, eternity, horrific beasts to be slain, labyrinths, immortality, heroes and antiheroes - it's all here in modern form, but nothing crucial really changes, does it? Reading this book is like watching a movie in your head. And through it all, the hapless Richard discovers a well of personal courage that he never thought existed. A timeless tale of humanity's existential search told anew, skillfully written and highly recommended. It's a trip!"
1,"Great book for anyone. . This book was required reading for my up and coming 6th grader. She hates to read, but this book has been a riot. She is not into Barbie, pink or much girly stuff. Fortunately, neither is Catherine. She and my daughter have a lot in common. I would highly recommend this book for all girls. If the boys can get past the sprinkling of puberty stuff they will like her antics too."
0,"Who designed this? . This is a very poorly designed product, especially considering it is far more expensive than most sets I have bought before. The clips that hold the curlers in place are huge, there is no where convenient to put them like the small metal ones. They are heavy and feel clumsy on my head. There is no where nice to grab the curlers so I burn my fingers sometimes. I guess it heats up fine, but they are so difficult to deal with that I have yet to get a nice curl."
0,"TOO LOUD!!! . Cute turtle, but way too loud! There's no volume control and the pieces are hard to get to stay in the spaces on the turtle. Give it 5 minutes and you'll get sick of hearing ""SHAPES, ANIMALS,COLORS!"" Yard sale, here it comes..."
1,"Great book . My son and I love reading this book together. He adores the pictures, the rhyming text, and all the animals portrayed in the book. A great read for all ages!"
0,"Beautiful writing, but very slow . In spite of my only chosing 2 stars for the book, I can see why ""The Light Ages"" was chosen for the World Fantasy Award. Macleod obviously is an experienced and careful writer, and his depictions of the town of Bracebridge and the lives of the people there are so well done that I could almost see the individuals he described.That said, though, I was not able to finish the book because the action is so slow moving. Macleod loves his descriptions of the people and the work of removing aether from the ground, but he spends so much time on those depictions that the narrative just creeps along. I finally gave up, even though I enjoyed reading about the world Macleod was creating, because I felt it was taking too long to get to the action."
1,"Revealing and informative . A very scholarly, well researched exposure of the real meaning of the scriptures, eliminating much of the esoteric meanings in the obscure, ambiguous and seemingly contradictory passages and enlightening us as to the meaning of terms in use at that time. By paralleling the recorded history of the times and the written word of the gospels we are ably guided to concur with the author that the apocalypse is a fait accompli. The bible and gospels should be understood not with the modern accepted meaning of the word but that of the meaning in use at the time of the writing. A fascinating, well written, book that is sure to captivate your attention. Highly recommended to searchers of the truth whether you be a bible reader or not.Louis H. Lafontaine, Eng."
1,"The Ambiguity of Genius . Laura Nyro was a gifted song writer and I loved the sound of her voice. If she was guilty of suicidal screeching, as has been suggested by some, what does that say about every other over paid rock diva? But honestly, this album has always left me a bit chilled. The landscape is bleak. There is a good groove going on Lucky, I never understood 'Dig those potatoes.' I wish I could have been there to talk her out of that line. Timer has wonderful potential, but oh that introduction. The recording of Sweet Blindness, endearing song, is a mess. There are under-appreciated gems here, December's Boudoir and The Confession. Don't dismiss this album out of hand, no artist could make a more penetrating statement about urban life. Some say it took them years to ""Get"" Laura Nyro. She grabbed me on my first hearing as a young teen-ager and never let go. If there is a more gifted singer-song writer out there, I don't know who it is."
0,Not happy with pendant . It was much smaller that I anticipated. So small can't see guardian angel on pendant. Very disappointed. The pendant had to be magnified to be able to take a picture.
0,"Connector is inadequate for a car installation . I purchased this car holder for my z520a phone. The connector on the bottom of this car holder is completely inadequate for a car installation. A slight bump of the wire, or taking a turn too quick will cause the connector to come loose. The Sony Ericsson engineers should have known better."
0,Don't buy this Adaptor . to any Playstation 2 owner do not buy this adaptor for your PS2 because it will mess up the system and it won't let you play DVD's or DVD-ROM games.it is also recommended by the Sony company that made the PS2 and PSone to not to use this adaptor only use the adaptor that has the Sony Playstation 2 or Sony Playstation logo on the adaptor.
1,Highly Relevant . The issues that prompted this film remain. Nothing has changed and that's what's scary. Charlton Heston as himself gives a frightening performance.
1,"Excellent movie! . I love this movie! The story line, the actors, the music are all excellent! This movie/play was created during the time when the Vietnam War was slowly coming toward an end.The songs compliment the political atmosphere in that era, and they certainly fit in today with what has been going on in D.C. for the past eight years. Yes, I'm including both Congress and the White House, ""Piddle, twiddle, and resolve, not one thing is ever solved"" fits what has been going on with Democrats and Republicans to a 'T'.Speaking of ""Piddle, twiddle, and resolve"" the only disappointment I have with this DVD is that the diector didn't include the full version of the song. You can find the full version on the CD of ""1776"" but not on this DVD.Other than that, excellent movie!"
1,good new jack swing . hard to believe this is 20 years old. I was grooving to this jam a whole lot back in the day. he hit some serious notes on this New Jack Swing inspired groove and Jam. the remix was cool as well.i bought the tape back in the day and wore this cut out.
1,"Unlimited power . I think that this book has helped me greatly to become a better person, see the glass half full, have a more positive opinion towards myself and others, and make me feel happier everyday. It would definitely help some one who has low self esteem issues. Very well written."
0,"a waste of money . I bought this product due to the sloping seats in my Dodge Caravan and thought that it was going to be very useful. Boy, was I wrong. When I tried to put this under my infant carseat it brought the carseat so far away from the back of the seat that I was unable to safely buckle it. There was no way to get a tight fit for the carseat using the 1 inch rule. (the carseat should not move more than 1 inch in any direction) I again tried to use the leveler when we converted to a convertible carseat,and yet again no luck. I recommend the poll noddles, they are much easier to use and a fraction of the cost."
1,"An exception to the rule... . ...that self titled albums are a band's best. While this album is by no means poor, there is certainly nothing fundamentally wrong with it, it does not compare to their debut ""Up the Bracket"". However, the album is built on the strained relationship between the creative core of the band, Pete Doherty and Carl Bart. This tense writing style is epitomised by the album's flagship song, ""Can't Stand Me Now"".I think that while this record is definitely worthy of any self respecting collection, if I could only buy one Libertines' album, this would not be it."
1,Hanna-Mcuen . I had heard one of their songs on GAC and decided to buy the CD just for the heck of it. It was fantistic. I had never heard a first album that was so polished with songs that I fell in love with.

1,"its a fun movie but not for wiccan seekers of the REAL THING . great movie but it is entertainment, and other than the book shop, and a few tools shown in the movie nothing else is ""TRUE"" be ware witchwannabeeees bright blessings, WW"
1,"Excellent quality dye injector . This tool for injecting dye into R-134a car A/C systems works exactly as it's designed. It uses disposable dye cartidges that are threaded on both end with caps. When you are attaching the plunger and coupler hose, be aware that large end is sealed inside with the piston, but the small end will spill if it isn't held upright when you attach the coupler hose. I was very happy to see that the plunger assembly is entirely made of metal. It only has rubber covers on it.Not sure where it's made, there's no marking I can see. It's a well made injector, though."
1,"nearly perfect. . This mug keeps my coffee or cocoa nice and hot for a long time,and the cap functions wonderfully as far as spill stopping but at the cost of being a complete pain to clean/get the coffee smell out of."
1,"A Reference Book One Dreams About . I used to work in a yarn shop. I have saved so many pamphlets and photo-copied a ton of patterns for sweaters, afghans, etc. that I would never make just to have patterns for the details. This book has helped me declutter! I can't believe that she has all of this in one book. Thank you, thank you, thank you! The patterns from ""Knitting on the Edge"" that I have used have all worked out. I have also easily been able to vary the patterns to work into the piece I was working on. She's made it very simple. And having worked some of the edges in - they really have made the pieces 100% richer looking. (Borrowed it from our library and had to buy my own copy.)"
1,"THE SMITHS BEST CD . I love this CD, to me it's a classic... it brings back memories from high school...some of the melancholy lyrics (like, 'I Know It's Over') can make you feel bad, that it feels good..LOL"
1,coby mp3 . very easy to operate. Downloads well and saving your place is better than others that cost more.
1,"Works Fine, Auto Shut-Off A Big Plus . This coffeemaker works well. It is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. The only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. The internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. The automatic shut-off is a big plus. I previously had a similar Toastess model (Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black) which was also a good coffeemaker. It had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. I kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise."
0,"English Subtitles, please? . I am about 20 minutes into this documentary and find that my interest in watching further is seriously challenged by my inability to understand what the three remaining brothers are talking about. Three middle-aged fellows muttering into their beards or to their feet or to the middle distance do not make riveting storytelling, if one has NO idea what they are saying in their country accents. My enjoyment and understanding would be enhanced 100% if there were subtitles. It's not too late to reach a wider audience...."
1,Fantastic product! . Bought this for my boss who uses 2 hearing aids. He absolutely loves it and it does not interfere with his hearing aids. The volume control is excellent and you don't need to use it on the highest setting it is so powerful. You can also adjust it to accomodate the pitch of different voices. Would highly recommend this product for those who cannot hear well.
0,Ehh... . This book didn't do much for me. Suffer The Children and Protege had me hooked instantly. This book seemed like it took forever to get things going. Some parts were so down-right boring I actually skimmed thru just to see if anything interesting was going to happen.

0,"Very dated material . The Q&A approach adopted in this book is very useful. It would provide for a very useful reference manual on M&A if its content were not so dated. Its discussion of taxes, accounting, and deal structures does not reflect recent changes in rules and M&A practices. It would be helpful if the author would update the material. Other more current and more comprehensive books on the subject that I have found useful include Mergers, Acquisitions, and Other Restructuring activities by Depamphilis and Bruner's M&A book."
1,"Love this Camera . So far I have had no complaints with this camera. It gives me all the manual options I like to have. I love the way it recycles so quickly so I am ready to take another picture. Somtimes the camera is out of focus and I can't quite figure out the problem. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm sure it's a setting that I'm not quite of. With all the options, I sometimes forget what setting I have it on."
0,Dead under a year . The card was good while it lasted but I expected a life cycle of greater than 1 year.
1,Good Card Good Price . Good Mini SD great price also and as always amazon great with getting it to me in a timely manner.
1,Better then the rest!!! . I've tried every one of these flea tick so called stoppers on my Rottie and hands down this stuff works the best and longest out of all of them. Will be buying this stuff from now on.
1,"I couldn't wait to see what happened next in this book! . I stayed up until 1:00 AM to finish it... it was so good, I couldn't wait to see what happened next! At first I thought it would be your typical ""chick"" type book... but it was not at all!!! At the risk of sounding cliche', I must say this book tells a wonderful and inspiring story of love, personal growth, and following your dreams. The NYC references were so fun to read, having lived in NYC myself. The story itself holds a great, positive message, and an interesting twist at the end. I REALLY HOPE to see this come out in a movie! I highly recommend this book!!!"
0,"HORRID HORRID RADIO . This radio is only good for Sirius. The CD player works on a whim and the controls are so tiny it was like they were designed for a mouse. The remote has never worked, even for selecting stations. No FM/AM reception and I live in a major metropolitan area on the east coast. It is far too big and bulky just for the Sirius part. I kept it tucked in a dark corner its infrequent usage warrants.My only regret about the review is that I cannot give it no stars."
0,"Not Very Good . Unlike her husband, Hillary Rodham Clinton has not demonstrated any talent for writing. Her ""Living History"" is really a sad demonstration of her skill or lack of it as an author. If you want to read some well written words try ""My Life"" by Bill Clinton."
1,TTTT Changed my life! . before TTTT my life was an empty pool of mysery. Post tttt It's been roses and sunshine. I can't even describe the joy in my life now. Thank you tttt!
0,"Unfortunately it's just too generic and non-involving. . I was hoping for more given who Simon's father is, but it seems he's gone down the same cheese-filled road that Phil did eventually. I thought that maybe we'd get to experience some of the innovation and originality that Phil had early in his career with early Genesis and his first couple of solo albums, but Simon gives us something that's OK to play in the background yet doesn't hold up to real listening, in my opinion. I'm not intentionally slagging the guy -- it's very apparent that he has talent, but he just doesn't quite have the creative songwriting tools to make it jump out yet."
0,Avoiding Malpractice 10 rules 5 systems 20 cases . This book is only 80 pages and offers suggestions about avoiding malpractice using 20 briefly described cases for purposes of illustration.This book is fairly elementary and offers little unique insight.For such a book I found the cost listed on the book($35.00)incredibly high.
1,"Good Book . He explains stuff really well, I like Johnny McArthur, he is level headed about the Bible and hasn't been blown back and forth by every wind of doctrine. When you are done reading the book it'd be a good gift for someone, because it's actually really pretty looking LOL"
1,"Great little book . This book is exactly what I was hoping for. It has great suggestions for for the modern bride who might be paying for most of the wedding along with her groom to be. Instead of old school rules and focusing on stuff one could care less about, like many of the books I have seen or have purchased.Great book and at a great price. It is not the only book one would need, but it is perfect in addition to another guide or organizer."
0,"Never worked . Little Tikes Bathtime BandI purchased this time for my two toddlers for Christmas. It looked so cute and my 15 month old loves music. It was going to be a surefire hit. Unfortunately it has never worked. We tried new batteries, pouring water simultaneuosly in the cups, one at a time, nothing has worked. As it was Xmas morning, the box is long gone. I wish we had read the reviews. Do not buy this toy unless you want some realy disappointed kids."
1,"Captivating true story but drawn out . The story line of this book is phenomenal. I started thinking it was going to be a quick read because the sample was hard to put down. The authors are very descriptive and there are very little grammatical errors. But, I started to get a little bored about 60% through. The detailing started to seem drawn out and it was difficult for me to finish. The build up to the conclusion was predictable ( in my opinion) which made it even more difficult to finish. I would still recommend the book to anyone who is looking for a detailed and highly researched account of what happened in Juarez during the span of murders."
0,"RTFM - and save twelve bucks! . If you need your info fluffy and pretty, here's your book, but it was cotton-candy to my hunger for bread and meat. I read the whole thing in the Border's parking lot, went back in and exchanged it for some remaindered cookbooks."
0,A waste of trees. . This was just awful. Schlock. Formulaic. Unoriginal. Remaindering is a mercy killing. Not a book to give someone if you want to get them hooked on fantasy fiction.
1,"Very good, although a coupla very famous and popular sketches were omitted from this collection . Not a bad compilation, even though the opera singer sketch and a coupla other oft-played sketches were somehow omitted. Very old clips were still enjoyed -- there were more of them than in more recent years, which were usually in color (from TV guest shots or from concerts)."
0,"not really Mac compatable . I bought this camera because it was advertised to be Mac compatible. Unfortunately, it only works with Mac OS 9 and below, which haven't been produced since 2002 or so. Also, the design of the camera is such that you have to place it at eye level (it doesn't pivot up enough) and yet there's no way to attach it to a laptop. So you have to place it on top of a pile of books or something to have it angle correctly.Too bad. I was hoping it would be an inexpensive camera to use in talking with my husband overseas."
1,"excellent PABLITO . I have to write that this album is the most beautiful from all albums of Pablo. Pablo sings more profeionally. His voice in the song Olvidarte jamás is very preciosa. The best songs are: olvidarte jamás, toda ley, gallo de pelea, se te olvido, vas a entender, como tenerte otra vez... Muchas gracias Pablito"
0,"Don't buy Blu-Ray if you have an Oppo Blu-Ray player (even w/ latest firmware). This disc will not play beyond menu . My Oppo BD-83 blu ray player has never hit a snag in six months of use (even when I was using it during their beta program, it played all DVD's and Blu-Rays). Then it met ""Summer."" The disc started to play a trailer and halted in the middle. Then it jumped to the main menu. There, despite hitting every ""play"" and/or ""select"" button on the remote to advance, it would do nothing except provide the universal circle with the red line through it on the upper left screen. I tried close to 10 times, reloading and so on. Nothing worked. I double-checked live to the Internet for the latest firmware updates. But my player is up to date. When I tried another disc, the player briefly had a problem until I restarted everything again. My player definitely did not like Summer or whatever Fox has put on this disc that is causing the problem. Beware."
0,"Sour grapes from a dramatic former butler. . When I made the mistake of reading this tell-all book,It was clear to me that the writer was very bitter. The book tells us little that shock`s,and seems to have been a means of revenge towards Marlo Thomas. What is also odd, is that not one unkind word is written about Phil Donahue,leading the reader to believe he must not have any say in his own home."
1,"Exciting stuff!! . If you are looking to understand the value of business process simulation from an executive stand-point, this is a great book.Profozich explains through examples and case studies how simulation can help companies make better business decisions and managage necessary changes in their operating environment.All business environments operate within areas of uncertainty. This book explains how simulation technology can help business managers understand and use this uncertainty to their advantage.Business simulation can support business managers across all functions of the enterprise and help create value in a number of ways. Unfortunately businesses are not taking advantage of this great technology. Profozich has managed to demystify the myth around the complexities of computer simulation and he explains the value proposition and approach in a very compelling way."
0,"who on earth greenlighted this!? . I bought this game on day one based on the fact that it was a next-gen shadowrun. I read about it and became very excited about the gameplay and the new ideas. But then I actually played it. With all the time, effort and money put into this game, why is there absolutly no single player story mode. This is based on a world with some of the richest history in pen-and-paper rpgs out there. Why could they not even muster up the time to put in even an average single player mode. (the lame bot matches and training missions don't count) I mean for crying out loud, even halo and gears of war had memorable storys and characters. And those were based on brand new ideas ad licenses. Its not that the gameplay is bad. The multi-player is actually very well thought out. But for a game that costs us 60 dollars, there is absolutly no excuse for no story mode. I'm not even going to start on the lack of maps. (which is pretty pathetic for a basically online only game."
1,"Evil power pop majesty... . On their debut album, Cheap Trick's masterful pop hooks were cut with a nasty metallic edge that quickly got sanded down on subsequent releases. Rick Nielsen's guitar crackles with a palpable electricity, and the sparse production refuses to add gloss or tidy up in any way. The vocal melodies are Beatlesque in the best sense, made all the more impressive by Robin Zander's uncanny ability to sing like both Lennon and McCartney. There's an adult malevolence at work here that is completely at odds with the harmless cartoon the band became. Forget the power pop bliss they're known for, because on this album Cheap Trick were aiming to rock."
0,This is horrible . This is a disgrace to racing and all car games in general... to bad such a powerful system does not have games like Metropolis street racing on the dreamcast. Dont buy this game... it is horrible!
0,"Avoid this brand! . I have a 20 pack of these, and niether of my recordable drives will accept them. I got one to burn, but all of the rest have been rejected at every attempt. Save yourself the trouble and look for another brand."
1,"""HIts the Mark"" RJ MacCurry, author of ""Fallen Angels"" . ""Strength and Honor: The Life of Dolly Madison"" by Richard (...) Cote is excellent reading and a work of art. Mr. Cote has once again shown that he is one of the best writers of our era. His work continues to excel and there is no limit to his artistic ability to dazzel the reader with his painting of history with a flair that only his author's brush can make. This is another masterpiece that hangs well beside ""Mary's World"" and ""Theodosia Burr Alston"""
1,"Pretty Good!! . This album is actually really good. Although short, it's definitely showsMonica has matured. Although the first track that was released was not that great, tracks like dozen roses and gotta move on makes us remember why fans will continue to support Monica. Hell No is definitely one of the best tracks on the album but what i didn't like is the fact that she tries the rapping too much. I prefer to hear her voice and think that she should stay true to the talented R&B; Singer that she is."
0,Oregon Lighthouses . I wasn't completely satisifed with this DVD. I felt it could have oferred more Scenery of the Oregon Coastline.
0,Mediocre. . This film bored me to death. The pacing is off and the protagonist is very poorly played. Not worth the effort.
0,"What went wrong? . Whomever designed this was definitely a minimalist. The ""slot"" for business cards is barely useable, the zippered compartment for the keyboard is a challenge to zip up- hope you're not in a hurry and there is absolutely NO room for an extra stylus, a memory card/stick. Save some $ and look for something else."
1,"Perfect . There is nothing I can say other than this is the perfect recording. Denyce Graves has chosen arias that we don't always get to hear and I thank her for doing so, she breathes live into the old standards from ""Carmen"" and introduces us to arias that will undoubtably become new favorites. Denyce's voice is absolutely fabulous, it's powerful yet calm and perfectly refined, I can say nothing bad about her voice or this recording."
1,"Don't you worry... . I agree with Ms Praiseworthy and Mr Eggdrop Soup, there's a straightforwardness to the jazz that makes it a little too much like fourplay, but at the same time, Mr Khan's rendition of Don't you worry 'bout a thing carries into a new height, ergo...I have the limit my review to that one song and give it some praise."
0,"Faulty battery . Got the phone yesterday and it was a nice looking phone. Exactly what i wanted. Heres the but.... The battery was warped. Very noticeably warped. Almost ready to explode. I threw it back in the box as quickly as i could, sealed it back and now i have to return it which will probably be such a hassle. I guess i could just purchase another battery to keep from having to go thru that headache. Motorola is really at fault though."
0,"BROKEN! . The glass jug came along with three other items I ordered from Amazon. And of course since I was so eager to try the jug I opened it first and uh, the thing was broken to 23443 different pieces. The ice container and the lid were the only things I could make out from the box. The packaging sucks! It wasn't even labeled as FRAGILE. Such a disappointment! I've ordered countless products from Amazon and never was I let down like this. Blah. Never again."
1,I luv it! . I love this coffeemaker and everything about it. Makes great coffee and it's super easy to use. I would reccomend this product to anyone who enjoys good coffee!
1,"Light and great . soft and comfy. After a couple wear and washes the started to get a little stringy looking, especially the white one."
0,"Wrong cable for this camera! . This cable does not fit the Coolpix 800, as advertised. Buy at your own risk."
0,"Waste of money... DON'T BOTHER! . I was so excited for this product as I can't sleep if I'm too warm and I love the cold side of a pillow! First of all, I got it and it was nearly impossible to let the air out like they said. Water spilled everywhere. I had 3 people working on it! Sure, it's cool for a little while. But after a few hours of sleep that thing REALLY heats up! I woke up one morning after about 8 sweating profusely because it had gotten so warm. Unbearably hot! It doesn't work...You know what people say about how if it sounds too good to be true it probably is? In this case, it is."
0,"Not the way to go . I brought this book and it's terrible. I took the 2001 AP and I am 100% sure I got a 5, even though I didn't get the results yet. I just know bio cold. I could have written a much better book than this (now there's an idea...) The authors talk about topics that are not important at all and do a 7th grade level review of the important topics. I would go with the Cliff's book or Barron's College Review Series in Biology if you want a review book. The best advise I can give is to read the textbook, and DO NOT waste any money on this book. This book is very poorly written."
0,"The interminal wheel of time series . After reading the reviews for this and the last couple books, I am very happy I gave up on the series in 2000. This probably would have been an excellent series if Jordan had kept it to 6 or 7 books. As it is, I think Jordan is just padding his wallet. The ego of the man is outrageous, to blame his readers, his CUSTOMERS, for getting bored with / not being able to follow his plot lines.Read George Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. He is handling multiple plot lines the RIGHT way."
1,"The Tipping Point Tops Them All . The Tipping Point is one the greatest books I have read (right up there with Stephen Covey). I loved the Tipping Point so much,I've been recommending it to family and friends since I started the Introduction. The Tipping Point will not only leave your notepad full of new ideas, but will change the way you think about work and your life.5-stars across the board!!"
0,"Regarding The Lost World . The Lost World is a lackluster, forced sequel to Jurassic Park, a childhood favorite of mine. The fact that I could identify it as such at the age of twelve, when the book was first published, should not bode well for the prospective reader."
1,An exciting book . Brian`s parents are divorced.He is going to visit his dad who lives in New york. When a tragic accident happens.He is forced to live in the Canadian wilderness with only a hatchet and a survival kit. Hatchet is one of the best books I`ve ever read . I would recommened it to anyone who likes adventures.
1,"A highly detailed look at Honda Motorcycle history . Many books on motorcycles abound with glossy pictures but contain little facts. This slim volume by Roland Brown is quite the reverse. The majority of photos are original B&Ws, not staged fashion shots, and there is ample text. It is not a coffee table book, it is a real book! The history begins with Soichiro Honda's start after WWII and traces the company's progress to 1989. For the real motorcyclist there is plenty of technical detail which is used to show the evolution from one machine to the next, rather than being just tabulated facts. The story of the development of motorcycles, as we now know them, and the fascinating saga of a multinational company's growth, make excellent reading. My only complaint is that a book this slim (150 small pages), really doesn't warrant a price tag of $25. Never the less, I still bought it, and was glad I did."
0,"Quaint and inaccurate . Quaint and inaccurate Reviewer: Eva Webster-Frizzell from Tennessee I have read and am appalled at the first of many inaccuracies in this book. The first, most glaring to anyone from the area is the caption of the two-page ""homecoming"" picture. The actual gathering is for a baptism. Anyone not recognizing this has spent a year not learning. Very disappointed in this book. I bought the book for my sister, a PHN working with people in very poor circumstances in the Sequatchie Valley of Tennessee. She had hoped to see the documentary but missed it. I hope she can look over the problems with the book, we can forgive Yankees who try to look at and into our lives and consistently get the wrong information. By the way, our widowed mother reared twin daughters without ever resorting to welfare."
0,"AWFUL . The seller themselves were prompt with shipment and great with packaging, but this product was not worth the care the took. We couldn't use the product at all. The holes were not properly drilled to allow any screw keep the product in place in the computer. The plastic is beyond cheap. We have gone back and ordered a proper aluminum bracket and hope to have better luck. Please beware when purchasing this item!"
0,"Very Simplistic, Not Pilates . I bought this DVD to supplement Brooke Siler's ""The Pilates Body"" because I wanted to understand some of the beginning exercises better by seeing them in action. I was very disappointed in I received. The exercises amount to simple calisthenics and include very few elements of a standard Pilates mat program. I'm no fitness guru but doing the entire program hardly raised my pulse or challenged my muscles.The DVD format itself is quite nice. If you are looking for some very low-intensity stretches and warmup exercises, this is a great DVD to get. However, calling this a Pilates DVD is a misrepresentation of its content."
0,"Just too boring.... . I wasn't happy with this book, but to be fair to this fabulous author, I went back and read it again. Unfortunately, it was just as boring the second time around. I don't know what happened to this one. The characters didn't shine, and there was no spark in the story."
1,"Expected more . Great concept, fair execution. I expected much more from these discs. Most of the tunes on disc 1 are a bit too sparse for my tastes...I was expecting more ""electro"" or ""electroclash"" styles. The Juan Maclean track is more of an agressive style that I like...too bad the rest isn't in this same vein.I mainly bought this for disc 2. Many classics I have on vinyl and I wanted to see how this guy handled the mix...doesn't really come through. The Bigod 20 track is actually ""Body to Body"" and not ""The Bog"". The second Front 242 track is pitched up significantly...I would have worked it into the mix elsewhere. These cds were mixed on Native Instrument's Tracktor software, with which I'm unfamiliar...maybe that has something to do with the odd style of mixing.Overall this is a nice addition to anyone's DJ mixed CD collection...good, not great."
1,"Zune Gear Bag . Nice case for the Zune. Fairly bulky, however hard to avoid considering the size of the player. Good protection for another electronic device especially in the hands of my teenage daughter."
1,"Great, fun ideas for families of all ages! . As the other reviews say, this book is fantastic! There are great ideas for holidays, but also neat suggestions for birthdays, school days (getting homework done), special rituals to start the day, for bedtime, mealtime, etc... Throughout the book there also are helpful websites and tons of insightful, creative ideas. It's unfortunate that Amazon doesn't sell it directly!"
1,"Excellent book on this complex person . I am shocked there are not more books about the personal life of this interesting person in history. This book gives a very good picture of Philip II and the forces that shaped him and the religion that governed every aspect of his life, loves and holy causes. Because of his long reign, and dealings with all the important persons of the 16th century, his personal attitudes shaped so much by his childhood, influenced the political, social and religious tide of that time. The conquests of lands in the name of God, influences the geography and history of today"
0,"great when new, died too soon. . I really like the concept of this machine. I use it sporadically, mostly to store grain, flour, etc. However, while it worked fine initially it progressively has had more and more trouble pulling enough of a vacuum to seal (the sealing part of the machine is only activated when the vacuum reaches a certain point). Now it is totally useless. The rubber seals look to be in good condition and I don't recall any trauma that occurred, such as liquid being sucked into the machine, etc. I don't think that I even used the machine to seal more than 50 bags before it stopped working. What a disappointment!"
0,"After 2 Years - the Sound is cutting out intermittantly like everyone elses reviews. . This was trouble free for 2 years, now the Sound is cutting out of the Center Channel like so many have reported. Double checked all the wiring - subbed in a different center channel, it cuts out intermittantly still.Many have noted that they had to crank the volume or turn it off/on to fix. I have found that if you simply turn off the ""MCACC Auto Sound"" and switch it back on, the sound will come back.But then the Sound will cut out again later. Happens daily at this point.This will be my last Pioneer I purchase.Now I'm looking at the Onkyo TX-SR607 - it seems to get a lot of good press at an affordable price.PIONEER HAD A DESIGN FLAW with this product!!"
1,"Strong argument for the impossible . We know that the media is left-wing ; everybody knows that, right? Not Eric Alterman and he'll tell you why the media is far more conservative than you think. While I think he overstates his case, this is an excellent, well-researched book.I don't think he'll change too many minds,as people who are convinced the media is liberal are not going to change their minds just by reading a book, even such a persuasive one as What Liberal Media.I would ask any readers of this book to read this with an open mind and perhaps you might come around to Alterman's point of view."
1,"A great gift for my sister. . I bought this as a gift for my sister. However, I myself have always enjoyed the short story genre for many years."
1,"Demons in Russia . Possessed is the first book to examine the phenomenon of demon possession in Russia. Drawing upon a wide range of sources--religious, psychiatric, ethnographic, and literary--Worobec looks at klikushestvo over a broad span of time but focuses mainly on the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when all of Russian society felt the pressure of modernization."
1,"Last good Local H cd for a long while. . The third of the Local H cd's, this one was the best of the bunch. It would have been a larger selling cd if it was promoted by the company the way it should have been.This is the last Local H cd where Joe Daniels is on the drums. Joe left shortly after & a new guy came in who doesn't have Joe's talent."
1,outstanding . This album is outstanding. Zucchero is a true find in exciting popular music. I can't keep his albums for myself...everyone wants them.
1,Recycled Bike Parts Clock . very well made product and nice looking. I gave it to a friend for a birthday gift - he liked it.
0,"Just ** for the production of this DVD,not for the content! . Well, the sound is supose to be Dolby Digital 5.0 but is only kind of stereo: the rear speakers are not used almost at all.The IMAGE...what a HORROR...sometimes is like a bad TV broadcast with lines and bad pixels all over!! Sometimes is just OK.The content is amazing, one of the best concert I saw of Alvin Lee:) a must have for any fan!!I realy don't know how they could produce such a bad DVD, shame that this is the only Alvin Lee DVD available(beside the Woodstock DVD)!!"
0,Boring junk . I gave this one star just because you can not give zero stars.the writing is stunted and changes tense on the fly. Sometimes you can not tell the author has changed who is speaking or thinking. I had too many times where I had to re-read several sentences to figure out who was saying what about whom. 85 pages in and it still had nothing to keep me reading. I gave up. Money in the toilet!
1,Attractive and convenient. . Better than a smelly pan sitting on the counter. With the liners it is easy to take to the backyard composter.
0,"A Little Disappointed . I was a little disappointed that the book did not elaborate a little more on the specific cases cited as examples. Most of the time it just indicates if a particular case either set a precedent or was a counter-example to a precendent, and then gives a footnote reference to legal documents. The book reads too much like a synopsis of a legal library. When statistics is discussed, it is an elementary exposition of basic concepts. What I wanted was lucid examples of how these basic concepts actually made a difference in legal cases. I did not get that from this book. This was the first book on statistics and law that I bought and read, so I don't know how to compare it to others. But I will select and try another to see if what I am looking for is out there."
0,"Too expensive! . I would give this book 5 starts, becausae it is written by such a well-known and eminient Islamic scholar. However, the price is such a deterrant, no-one but financial institutions will read it. This is a complaint against many Islamic authors - they rip you off with the extortionate prices of their books. What happend to the Quranic injunction to spread knowledge??"
1,"Few details on Con's and consistent warnings that you will be caught . I liked the book, although I was looking for a much more in depth treatment of the subject. The author consistently stresses that if you choose to be a con artist you will be caught and exhibits some frustration that con artists are not punished more severly than they are, since most con artist crimes are perceived as crimes the victims brought on themselves through their own greed and avarice.The title is somewhat misleading. Don't read this is you want to actually be a con artist as you won't learn too many tricks. There is a detailed explanation on how to short change someone, which I found interesting, but most other con artist tricks are given vague explanations.If you want to know about con artists read this as part of a more extensive study as it does not stand on its own as a resource."
1,"Growing Pains . Sheila Peele-Miller wonderfully captures a young woman's growing pains. This is a true example of ""what looks good, is not always good for us."" I felt myself feeling bad for Alicia. She loved so hard, but Derek was damaged goods. Hopefully he learned something at the cost of losing most likely the best woman he ever had. I enjoyed reading ""Painted Picture.""B. RichardsonGAAL Book Club of Atlanta"
1,"THIS WAS RETURNED . THIS CD CHANGER IS GREAT I'VE HAD ONE IN MY CAR FOR 15 YEARS. BUT THE ONE I GOT THROUGH YOU GUYS WAS DEFECTIVE AND WHOLESALE AV DIDN'T HAVE ANOTHER ONE , SO I HAD TO BUY IT SOMEWHERE ELSE MY ACCOUNT SHOULD HAVE BEEN CREDITED ACCORDINGLY. THANK YOU KEITH STEINKE"
0,"Low quality. Does not last . After about 10 charge cycles in the Olypus charger, it does not even hold a charge anymore. The capacity was never as much as the original Olympus battery and it continually got worse. It did not cost much but still was not worth the price. I definitely do not recommend this battery."
1,"Classic religious terms are explained in ordinary language . This book contains two memorable stories. The first deals with being a Member of the Body of Christ even when you don't care for the other person sharing your pew. And there is a memorable answer to the question,"" What can one do if one finds it impossible to affirm certain tenets of the Creed?"""
1,"Dogs love it! . My two terrier mixes (20 and 30 lbs., respectively) absolutely adore their new Ruffians Octopus. The smaller dog has a little trouble gripping this size, but the larger especially loves tossing and squeaking her new favorite possession (sometimes to noisy excess). Best of all, neither dog's aggressive chewing appears to have made a dent in more than two weeks.Highly recommended. Great fetch item."
0,Are You People Kidding? . This is not a 5 star film. And I have to agree with Acute Observer in finding this not realistic or believable in many aspects. As flawed as our government is I highly doubt that the FBI would allow a club that hunts young black men to continue on while they look for more evidence. And I found it impossible to believe that Debra Winger's character could continue to love Berenger after discovering that he was a racist murderer. This film is a guilty pleasure- albeit a wierd one. It plays more like a tv movie than a brilliant feature film. It is extremely dated and is written for a junior high or high school level of intellect.
0,zumba buns and thighs . This dvd would not play. Thought was going to be new but was just a burnt dvd in a case with a printed picture
1,Loved it. . Very entertaining. Spent a lot of nights plagued with insomnia watching Glee. Wish season 4 was available. Great music and show numbers.
0,"Good Idea, Ineptly Done . I'd never read Sandra Brown, and, based on ""The Switch,"" won't look to read more.A potentially interesting plot was ruined by ludicrous dialogue, unbelievable characters, and extremely unlikely plot twists (even allowing for the initial premise). And anyone who was surprised by the ending ought to be ashamed.No, wait. That's not true. Readers who thought early on that they had spotted the ending were encouraged to think otherwise by the fact that in several places Brown refers specifically to Melina out of the context of a conversation. E.g. on page 344 a new chapter section begins: Melina repeated to Chief the half of the conversation that he hadn't overheard. Well, it wasn't Melina, we find at the end, so Brown effectively set up a climax, as it were, that made no sense.Too bad. Identical twins can make for interesting reading, but they don't make the grade here."
0,"Actually it should be no stars . I have only written reviews for books I have genuinely liked. This is the first time I have written a ""Don't buy this book"" warning. Buy it used or get it from the library if you must read it. But it is a plotless waste of time and I am more sorry about that than I can say."
1,"I didn't believe you. It works! . I saw this product in a pet store and decided to go online to read the online reviews of the product before I actually bought it. All the reviews were surprisingly positive so I figured I'd try it - why not? At least, I could listen to it and relax even if the animals didn't. Well! My two dogs (a shep mix and an akita mix) and the two cats were actually listening and then they went to sleep! It really did calm them down!"
0,Cheap . This product is cheap. It looks cheap and I am sure it is not very durable. I should have spent a little more to get better quality but thought I was getting a good deal. The only use I may get out of these is to save them for a camping trip or inclement weather. Maybe they can protect the new mats I will be ordering.
0,"Babe of Darkness . I found the first Babe movie adorable, whereas Babe: Pig in the City somewhat lacking. The dog/street scene was enough for me to want to stop watching the movie. Expecting to be entertained by a ""feel good"" movie, I was grossly disappointed. I would not recommend this movie for any age."
0,"christina's having another identity crisis . from puerto rican school girl to wannabe hoochie mama wishing she was ghetto to kissing madonna at the vma's what will christina do next i wonder but put out more crappy cd's with lil kim, timbaland or whoever just to get street credibility."
0,"Waste of money . I was very eager to buy this CD. I have the CD Elixir and I love it. I saw and heard fourplay in Atlanta and they were awesome. However, this CD has too much computerized music. Too many sythensized voices. Very predictable. In my estimation, a bunch of tracks to play on smooth jazz radio stations or in an elevator as mindless filler. I didn't care for this one at all."
0,"Doesn't last long . I purchased this item as a Christmas gift. It lasted less than one day before it began to leak air. The net and stand part lasted longer before it began to lose air---almost three days! It is really too bad because if the quality were better, this would be a wonderful, fun item."
1,"Best -and ONLY- book of its kind . It's an enormous improvement from the second edition, which I also own a copy of. The book covers everything you need to know to pass state and national board examinations and become a licensed dispensing optician. My only complaints are that its contents are ordered somewhat counterintuitively, and that it's a very large, heavy volume (I have enough to tote around with my tools!)"
0,"How's Reverend Moon Doing? . Rev. Moon, the guy the republicans don't want you to know about is the man ""With The Plan"" according to Poppy Bush- maybe his divine guidance helped shape Dumbya's economic miracle. Afterall, Moon says he's the REAL messiah! What else could explain the oceans of lies spun out by the winger think tanks and reported as gospel truth if divine intervention isn't involved? Find out more- google ""Moon Primer""."
0,"Difficult to Read . A good way to describe this book might be to say that it is what /Reminiscence of a Stock Operator/ would have been like had Philip Roth written it.Many times while I was reading this, I had to look at the back cover and reread Ace Greenberg's quote: ""Buzzy Schwartz is a winner....All else is nonsense."" Because this book is so full of insipid nonsense, you might forget Schwartz is, in fact, a winner.I suggest checking it out at the library and reading only the last two chapters, which actually have something in them that could be called ""lessons"". (Please note the title of this book.) Forget the rest, it's nonsense. Like many other reviewers here have said, there is no system on a silver platter. Take what you can find and do your own research.Whatever you decide, realize that no great trader would ever ""need"" this book, certainly not for its ""psychological insights"". Buzzy wouldn't have, at least."
0,"lousy . Theres nothing worse than computer graphics, not to mention trying to make a make a sequal or re- make call it what you will. sometimes things are better left alone! an absolute insult to the 80s classic American Werewolf in London. Those of you who grew up when I did know what Im talking about. AS far as Im concerned there were very few classic horror movies made from the 90s up to present time.. now everything is done with computers,Even our horror movies are now subject to this lazy key punching generation LONG LIVE RAY HARRYHAUSSEN!!!!!!!"
1,"Better Than The Movie . Hampton Sides' telling of the rescue of 500 POWS, survivors of the infamous Bataan Death March, by U.S. Army Rangers in the Philippines during the waning days of World War II is an outstanding job of reportage. Sides tells the story from the eyes of the rescued and their rescuers, building suspense that wasn't always present in the The Great Raid, the film adaptation of his story. As a working journalist for more than 30 years, I know I good story when I read one, and this one falls into that category."
0,"This book is not the leading Social Psyc book. . Skynyrd had a great point. As an undergrad, I have never seen such unethical use of graphing in my life. I would not recommend this book. There was plenty of info, but ethics are ethics. This book violated those ethics and shame on the publisher for printing that."
0,"Don't buy Customer Manager . All the reviews here are dead on. This is NOT something I'd recommend at all. Yes, it work on a very basic level without syncing to Quickbooks. But it crashes all the time and it has tons of quirks. Buy something else."
0,"Buyer Beware, Not What It Looks Like . Recently I cancelled my cable connection after seeing that I could save $35 a month by just buying this book and using it instead. What I got was really disappointing, it doesn't even have Facebook inside it. My kids are now restless at night because they can't see their friends' pictures and updates. My wife isn't too happy either, this book hardly mentions anything about celebrities. This is really misleading and I am contacting the publisher. If you are looking for the whole Internet ON PAPER then look elsewhere, don't buy this!"
0,"1980's revisited! . I recently purchased this dvd. I was thinking about going to either Mallorca or the Canary Islands next year. This dvd was informative but it is very outdated. It says 2000, but the film was done back in the 1980's. The sound quality is not very good and it looks like they transferred the film from a vhs tape. I kept the dvd just because there is some good information, and it does cover the different Canary Islands."
0,"The ImmorTalist Manifesto . I have never read such derivative, kitchy, self-serving, cash-cow milking drivel in my entire life. This author needs to start his quest for immortality by seeking to grow up.A representative quote:""My childhood friends have all grown old, fat, and ugly.I now look more like their son than their classmate or peer. I am still getting carded by bouncers at bars and clubs. I will outlive my enemies - and marry their children."""
0,NO DVD why . I want this on DVD when it is released on DVD in anamorphic widescreen I will give it a better review.
0,Born to Rule . Did not receive hard copy. I would like to receive this book if paid for it. I receive an electronic version.
0,"Not the correct power cable . I ordered this as a replacement for my Airport Extreme power cable. It is not an Apple product and is the wrong size for the Aiport Extreme. Therefore, it was of no use to me. It is very frustrating to have the product listed as being for an Airport Extreme when it is no such thing. Will not buy again from this seller."
1,"Valley Forge 2 Postion White Powder Coated Aluminum Bracket . Good product and good customer service, however the mounting screws are wrapped in a small plastic pouch and stuffed inside of the small hollow space. This space has unfinished sharp edges inside and I recieved a 1 inch cut across my finger when I remove this hardware.Valley Forge 2 Postion White Powder Coated Aluminum Bracket"
1,"Kindle . The Kindle device is truly amazing. I bought four of them; one for myself and three as Christmas gifts.I have two suggestions for future redesigns:1. Relocate the On-Off and the Antenna switches from the back of the device to the top leading edge. This makes it unnecessary to remove the device from its cover.2. To the right and left of the ""amazonkindle"" logo, add raised areas for thumbs to ""dig in"", making it easier to hold the device (especially when in bed, about to drift off into ""la-la land""!)."
1,"Fantastic . Fantastic Shredder. I've had others that granted, were cheaper, and they were total JUNK. This one is flawless. You don't have to position the paper just so in the slot, like with my last junky shredder. It's a little bigger, size-wise, than others, but worth it for how it easily chews up a whole envelope full of junk mail."
1,"Great Show!! . This show is colorful and easy to follow for small children. The lessons are simple and an example of good values which is rare these days on television with all of the mindless, worthless cartoons out there. My son loves it and laughs with the characters, I feel good because he is also getting a good lesson! I have recommended this to all of my friends with young children."
1,"adorable for ice cream . My kids LOVE these spoons. One did break when an enthusiastic ice-cream fan used it to try and scoop out some hard ice cream from the freezer, but they are great (and very cute!) to eat your ice cream with."
1,"I like everything here, but the leads. . Domingo, bless him, just doesn't make Wagner for me. Too light, I think. AndNorman's matronly voice doesn't fit Kundry imo. if you like these singers, it's a gorgeous recording."
1,"Great with Medifast Diet . I am currently on the medifast diet and have had trouble with constipation. This has helped tremendously. I even have my Husband on the tea to help with the liver claims. Taste is not bad, not good just bland. Try a small box and then you'll buy the larger size like I did!"
0,"YHE WORST OF ALL . IT LAST me like 1month of use, it sucks.. really really sucks.. i mean she felt apart she broked down in a hundred pieces.. IT SUCKS DONT BUY IT.. NOT RECOMENDED AT ALL"
1,"Could be better but Still very Good!! . Enigma: The Best of Jeff Hardy is a real Good DVD. I own the Jeff Hardy and the AJ Styles DVD. AJ's DVD is a lot better, the Enigma: The Best of Jeff Hardy was a lot more better then I expect it would be. Hardy only been in TNA for one year and I know TNA is trying to make money so they rush this DVD out. But the matches are good, dam the cage match is awesome and his match with AJ Styles is great even if I think they can have an even better one. The DVD is good and I would love to own a lot more TNA Wrestling DVD's, but there all selling out in a lot of stores so my advice to you is to get it when you can. Amazon.com I'm sure has a good stock on them. Enigma could have been better in a longer run but it's still a fun Wrestling DVD."
1,"We love this one . I have read all the bad reviews for this game. It is boring when you use the controller but if you have the dance pad it's a blast. I have five kids 9-1yrs. and they all love to watch someone do this game on the dance pad as well as do it. This is a dance pad game. The dance pad plugs in like a controller and has all the same buttons as the controller. This is fun to jump around trying to keep up. Try the dance pad if you still have the game, it's worth it. They have other dance games as well like jungle book. Hope this helps"
0,"Creed's a horrible, horrible band... . I'm sorry, but everytime i hear Creed, I have to shudder. No, I'm not a harcore punk, and I don't listen to oldies all day. But Creed is the most unoriginal band I have ever heard. Find some music with actual emotion."

0,"Avoid Americopy Vendor . These things were horrible from this vendor. I know its impossible to know on a blind shot. but dude, these bags were like vacuum sealed together. I had to peel open each envelope. Huge paid in the neck. You should be able to just open it and insert whatever you put in.It was so annoying, I would literally get the blow gun on my air compressor and blow air into about 20 or so at a time just to prep them for use."
0,"Attention!!!!! . I used these product for two years, and I bought them from other websites. It is the first time I bought this product on Amazon but it tuned out to be a fake.The product I had been used smelt nothing, but this one smells very differently and it smells like a molten metal. I am so angry and it's in my trash can now.I need an explanation !!!!!!!!!!!I seriously have been using this product for two years!!"
1,"perfect!! . I was looking for this kind of socks to wear on my wedding day! And they are perfect, exactly what i was looking for!. Good quality, comfortable, good price and delivered on time!"
0,"get what you pay for . The adapter did not have a spring loaded tip like pretty much all other car adapters do, which is probably why it took some fiddling to get the adapter to make contact with the socket and provide power. If it was moved slightly, power would cut out and it would need to be adjusted again. Also, the fuse recently burnt out on mine and can't really be replaced. It's cheap and works technically, but unless you only need one for one weekend, spend your money on something built a little better."
0,"DISAPPOINTED!!!! . I am a strict vegetarian who does not use any animal products, so you can imagine my shock when I opened my shipment and found that there were REAL COWHIDE slippers inside!!!! The description clearly says 'FAUX' and the box that came was NOT faux. The description is incorrect in the listing, or someone slipped the wrong pair into the shipment by accident - TWICE!!! Either way - horrible mistake!!!! I bought a pair for my father and one for my boyfriend, who is also a strict vegetarian. Both boxes contained real cowhide slippers. (Why does Amazon NOT let you choose zero stars?)"
0,"DO NOT BUY! . This was my first experiance with an electric pump, and was awful! The motor was very weak and it did not provide the proper suction. I called the company and told them of my complaints, they sent me a new motor and new washer rings (the rings in case the suction was being broken) however neither helped. This pump was loud, and painful and did not allow me to pump enough milk. The suction release is manualy operated but the motor could not keep up with the number up times I would need to relase per minute to simulate my baby's sucking, witch made let down even harder! I do not suggest to anyone to buy this product."
1,"Edge 305 - Good For Day Trips, But Not For Tours . The Edge 305 has all of the bells and whistles that you would want in a bicycle computer. Each of the functions is relatively easy to use, providing great infomation concerning speed, cadence, heart rate, elevation, ascent, grade, etc. The only draw back is that the battery does not last more than a few hours. This is a negative if you are out on a tour. Two weeks ago I did GRABRAAWR in Wisconsin. This seven day ride covering 430 miles was great, but every night I needed to find an outlet so that I could recharge the battery. This is the only fault that I can find in the Edge 305."
0,"Beware. This book has almost killed me . Sturve bacteria to death. And where, in bowels (!?) What an increadible idea ! By using this diet you practically illiminate any iron containing food from your menu. So if you have digestive deasese and most likely, already having difficulties absorbing Vitamin B complex and iron - you are on the way to killing yourself. After being on SCD for 7 months and becoming progressively weak and pale, I've had a routine blood test done, which came up with Hematocrite of 23 (!) At that point my physycian was insisting on blood transfusion, but I was lucky to get out of the situation with just Iron pills."

0,"not universal . The description of ""universal fit"" is misleading. It was much too big for my Hyundai Accent. Plus hard to install. Better off to buy entire shaft assembly."
1,"Good book.... although not without flaws... . As non-biased reader (no Scottish roots or ties), I found this a good book. Its coverage of the Scottish Enlightenment is excellent - and this is the best part of the book. He covers both the individuals and their theories very well and its highly readable. However, after he moves on from the Enlightenment, it becomes quite tenuous. Claiming the Scots were responsible for the British Empire, America and Canada is a little bit of a stretch? Also, this book can be a bit of a heavy read at times."
1,"Absolutely Essential Viewing . So if you're a bit like me, you look forward to New Year's Eve and July 4th...not just for all the fun and festivities (and fireworks on July 4th) but also for the Twilight Zone marathon on SciFy. Every year I always catch and episode or two that I've never seen before, and catch a few I know by heart, enjoying every second of it.So during the winter months this year I decided to splurge and buy the entire series box set, every episode in original air date order. This is the Ultimate Twilight Zone package for any fan. Plus bonuses too many to list, complete with a booklet which gives a quick synopsis of every episode. Simply put, you can't do better than this. All struck from the original camera negative and magnetic soundtrack it says right here on the box, and it definitely looks that way on my TV screen.So do yourself a favor, if you're an old fan or new, grab this set and beat those cold winter night blues, you will love it!T"
1,Love These! . I love these Dick and Jane books! My son got so much better at reading going through these. I don't know why they ever stopped making books like this.
1,poignant documentary . This is a poignant documentary of life among the remaining Jews in the Carpathians. It has outstanding traditional Jewish and Gypsy music and is interesting for showing the connections between the two communities.

1,Sierra Club 2002 Wilderness Calendar . I love our country and I was not disappointed when I opened my Sierra Club wall calender. The pictures are wonderful. I could not have chosen any better locations myself. The quality of the prints are superb enough to frame.
1,"How someone attitudes could change feelings!By:Brenda Amador . Stargirl (Susan Caraway real name) after being most of her life in homeschooling going to a public school was weird for her. Once she got to Mica Area High she had every pair of eyes on her, used to wear long, pioneer-style dresses, played a ukulele in the halls and in lunch room, and carried her pet rat Cinnamon with her.She made people happy with most of her things after a while. Leo Borlock follows the unspoken rule at Mica Area High :don't stand out rule. But when Stargirl gets to him everything changes and Leo falls in love with her.This book is absolutely amazing this was one of my favorite books its a book that once you open you can't close."

A perfect balance of Lao Tzu and Confucious.However there is a more elegant and poetic English translation under a different title is translated by Thomas Cleary:""Back To Beginnings"" (on Shamabala Publictions) though Cleary did selectively leave out some of the numbered meditations (and their numerical references).Note:Hong Yingming's Taoist mane is Huanchu Daoren.Get both books and understand the extent of the translator's art.If you read Chinese don't get Back to Beginnings get this version because it has English and Chinese side by side.One can learn from any version, this book is special."

Having only been familiar with Demons & Wizards (the side-project of Iced Earth's Jon Schaffer and Blind Guardian's Hansi Kursch - a project which I absolutely love) I figured it was high time to check out Schaffer's prime band. I could not have been more disappointed. If The Blessed and the Damned is Iced Earth's ""Best Of"", I will definately not be wasting my time checking out their other cds. This may sound harsh, but I had high expectations after listening to Demons & Wizards. Schaffer, hook back up with Hansi and make a third D&W cd. Please!"
0,Very slow and much too long . A few friends recommended this book and I had read many good reviews so I was looking forward to it. I did not like it and had to push myself to finish. A VERY slow start and the pace never picked up.
1,"Love . Bought for our grandson he loves them, plays with them every time he comes over to vist papa and granma"
1,"Wickedly amazing. Fantastic game . The freedom to move anywhere on the huge, fanstastically detailed mountains make the game worth buying. The tricks, soundtrack and snow effects are gravy. I really wish it supported simultaneous multiplayer ( especially across xbox's ) but its still good."
1,"they still got it! . hey, i just got the cd... the boys still got it! this new one is so great. it such a great new sound. it's like a new style of music meets the guys from the 90s. i love it! they've really matured! oh, and i reccomend that ya'll get the duel disk if you can. it's only like a dollar more and it's got some great stuff on the dvd. hey, for all ya'll goin to a concert, scream loud for me and all us here in NC, cause they're not comin back down here. :( oh well, i love em anyway! 5 years hasn't changed my opinion at all."
0,"Too focused on pronunciation and learning without a book . After these lessons, I can recognize the phrases ""Do you understand..."", ""Do you speak..."", and ""Do you know..."" instantly. And I can answer them without thinking about my response. But that's all I've really learned, and one of the most intimidating features of Russian is the alphabet.The pronunciation is easy to follow, and the repetitiveness will ensure that these phrases are etched into your memory forever. However, on the whole, it's not a great introduction or overview of the language itself."
0,"Not the best . Takes a bit of doing to get results, not sure why, maybe the blades. Had one before that worked great until it was dropped."
0,"lame . From the box, this looks like a good horror movie, but it's not. It's slow, and there are no really scary scenes. It's creepy, but nothing at all like the Blair Witch Project.If you're looking for a good newer horror movie, don't waste your money on this movie. Get House of Wax or Hostel instead."
1,"Powerful . What a powerful group when they came on the scene!! ""More than a Feeling"" boosted them into worldwide following. ""Peace of Mind"" and ""Don't Look Back"" are great tunes on this album!"
0,"Very disappointing . Considering all the information and documentaries out on the subject of Frank Lucas and his Harlem Heydays, this one is extremely disappointing. Amateur and uninformative, this one was a stinker."
0,"Huh? . Word of mouth and all the 5-star reviews of this book had me very excited to read this series but... it just wasn't that funny. Nowhere close to Pratchett or Adams, who I find hysterical. The ending was quite depressing. I kept waiting for it to improve (or get funny) on the next page, and it did when I finally finished..."
0,Baaaad . I haven't received my products anymore! Gonna get the responsable people and sue them!!!! I wrote to Amazon but haven't hear anything from them!!!
0,"Read it if you must . Good story, terrible writing.Anderson's prose is trite, unimaginative, and, far too often, simply laughable. Which is a shame because the story is compelling.This is a key part of the Star Wars extended universe, however. So, read it if you must. But you've been warned."
1,Best deal for the price! . The Gleim CPA audio cd's are the best deal for the price you pay. I just passed the FAR section of the CPA exam and all I did was listen to the cd's on my way to work in the morning. I didn't use any other study materials. I highly recommend this product.
1,"Great, but missing things. . I thought this movie was wonderful. It was suspenseful and kept you in your seat. The acting was better than the last movie, as some of the lines were kind of cheesy. The only thing is, they left out 3 major events! Chloe and Buck's wedding, Amanda and Rayford's wedding, (actually, they never even introduced her!), and most importantly, someones death. But I won't mention whose, for the sake of those who haven't seen the movie, or read the book. I did like this movie. I really did. I just have to wonder why they left these parts out."
0,"Dissapointed . Wow. What a dissapointment! I am surprised to see so many positive comments on the album, but glad to see that a few know what I am talking about. I have both of Fiona Apple's prior albums and found that this one cannot compare. Maybe she should have stuck with Jon Brion? Maybe there was a reason her record label didn't want to release it?I bought this album based on the title track which I loved when I heard it on the radio, as I felt that this track showed some growth, musically and personally. But the rest of the album seems to lack in melody, direction and substance. Even her lyrics don't seem as profound as before, but that could possibly be because I grew up too.I would NOT recommend this album."
1,"A very good solo Raider entry . ""Death's Deal"" is a fine entry in the solo Raider Western novel series. This series of books focused on the character of Raider, working alone for the Pinkertons after Doc Weatherbee leaves the agency.Most of the plot is taken up with a grueling cattle drive, which brings out the courage and cowardice, good and evil of everybody involved. The major villain is more of a contemporary sociopath than the standard Western bad guy.The solo Raider books just don't have the quality of the earlier Hardin series, but this one is excellent.Highly recommended."
1,Sex & the City meets Martha Stewart! . This book was a cute short read with some really yummy recipes (the brisket and the chicken were DELICIOUS!) and humerous and insightful stories to accompany them. Definately worth a read!
0,"Eli Roth is a hack . Clever spoof? Scary Movie was a clever spoof. This piece of garbage is poorly scripted, poorly acted, etc....etc..... After seeing it I wanted to open my skull and scoop out any memory of it. Do yourself a favor, if you are thinking about buying this mess please DON'T reproduce. The world has enough stupid people. And by the way Amazon, how about adding a negative stars option to the rating system. It felt dirty having to give this crap even one star."
0,"This band is complete garbage . I bought this album mistakenly when I was wondering about a song that was featured in the movie ""High Fidelity"" and someboy told me it was ""Peppyrock"" by this band BTK, turns out it was not the song and I hoped that maybe the cd would be good anyway but turned out to be complete and utter garbage. Do not buy this CD they are a rip off of The Chemical brothers. Nothing drives me crazier than when soneone tries to mix both rap and rock."
1,Awesome sweeper for pet hair! . I absolutely love this sweeper. I keep it charged all the time and use whenever there is anything to pick up. It actually picks up pet hair better than my vacuum cleaners.
1,"indispensible . As a person of partly Greek ancestry, and Protestant upbringing, when I contemplated conversion to Roman Catholicism, I asked the priest why I should not become Orthoodox. He smiled and said that would be going in the right direction but why not come all the way home. He gave me this book. Indeed I became a Roman Catholic.I count as kin and the best of friends and brothers in Christ many Orthodox. I am thankful and do believe that I understand them and their religion better than ever for reading this book. Though it condemns certain errors, Soloviev speaks with a true voice of love for the Orthodox.This personal note is all I can add to the excellent reviews that have gone before mine. I do recommend this book especially to Orthodox Christians who are so very important to the future of all Christendom."
0,How to waste (dollar amount) . As an avid fan of Patricia Cornwell I think this book was garbage. What were you thinking? I purchased this book for vacation reading and should have thrown it away when the trout and crabs started their conversation. Hoping it would improve I continued reading. What a disappointment! I'm sorry I wasted my time and money.
1,the best cookbook on god's green earth . My sisters and I grew up with this cookbook. It is the most-borrowed book I own. i would pay major bucks to have it in hardback. you will never need another cookbook.
0,"A let down . I was very excited to watch this movie. Sadly, I wish that I could get the hour and a half of my time back. A total let down"
1,Interview with the Vampire dvd . The original Twilight movie except without all the teenage drama. If you're a fan of vampire movies this is a must for collection.
1,Wonderful Book full of great information . A wonderful book for the costume jewelry enthusiast. Great pictures and fantastic writing. It gave me a great insight on the quality and craftsmanship of unsigned pieces of costume jewelry. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in collecting costume jewelry
1,"Easy Read on a Complex Subject . This book covers great spans of time and geography and illuminates little discussed, but important and interesting, stretches of history. I found it an easy read, despite the complexity and many characters.The only downside is that more detailed maps, and perhaps a timeline, would have been useful."
0,Destined To Witness . I could not even finish this book. It was written with such arrogance and puffing!I found the author to be quite contrive about the true nature of the Holocust and more intent on his personal injustice.He was lucky that he was young and had friends in Germany. His father being a king of some sort is put high onhis list of achievements although the treatment of the women involved with himself and his father would not be so prized.I am going to put this one down and go on to something more worth my minds time. ~
1,"nostalgic and heartwarming . My father grew up in the north end of Boston, and it brought back lots of fond memories of mygrandmother and the great meals we had at her home with lots of family and friendsgathered around. The recipes are great, although I would have loved more photos!"
0,"Really not that great... . I bought this book in October - it is now February and I have yet to make anything out of this cookbook. I love vegetarian cookbooks and was looking for something quick and easy, but nothing in this book sounded that appetizing or that filling to me (I am not a picky eater by the way). I'm sure there are other vegetarian cookbooks out there that are way better. Skip this one."
1,"Spoiler . For me, this was a suspense novel, not a whodunit.This is how I saw it: While Mike is trying desperately to get a hold of her life and find a reason to keep on going, a flawless beauty commits suicide out of sheer boredom with her perfect life. Then memories of the girl start to creep back into Mike's consciousness; she was contemptuous of Mike and all things imperfect. Faced with this, Mike makes a decision about her own fate, leaving this reader furious with the dead girl. So who murdered whom?"
1,"3120 code scanner . the reason i bought the scanner was so that i could read the codes on my 95 olds but when it i got it, found out that it does not work on the 95 models. over all i love have it. it works fine on all the other vehicles that i have. would love to know if there is another hook-up that i can use with it to be able to read the codes on the 95 olds. it is a great investment for the do it your self person"
0,"Is there a half star option . Great Firelighter.I picked up this book at the same time as I picked up The Forgotten Soldier by Guy Sajer, thinking that both were non-fiction accounts. Boy was I wrong.What I don't understand is what possessed the author into thinking he had a novel in him? Someone deluded him horribly. The book is at times unreadable for any number of reasons. It is unbelievable nonsense, terribly written and edited, and historically inaccurate to the point of being laugh out loud stupid. Which is what I must have been for purchasing it without spotting that bulge of one star reviews.The book is very well reviewed by the authors friends and family and some people who owe him money and that is all."
1,"Great new band - Rossdale still has it!!! . I was a huge fan of Bush and now am a fan of Institute. It does sound similar to Bush, but probably because Gavin Rossdale writes all the lyrics and sings all the lead vocals. It has a harder edge than Bush did, but overall I'm glad its similar.I was sad to see Bush break up and am now glad to have another oppotunity to enjoy Gavin's incredible voice and interesting lyric style.If you liked Bush, you should enjoy this album."
1,"An Underrated Guilty Pleasure . Although critically slashed upon its release it's actually a broad, very entertaining comedy with many funny sequences and performances. Tom Hanks and Bruce Willis are strangely miscast but are by no means bad. De Palma's direction is as stylish as ever and the cinematography is quite beautiful. Worth seeing for the eye-popping camerawork in opening five minutes alone. Had this been an original adaption the critical concensus would have been far better.The DVD offers a nice anamorphic widescreen transfer and no other extras but for the low price it's great."
0,"horrible . This is one of the worst surf movies ever! I mean all of the footage comes from other surf movies that are much much better, and it does not go into enough depth about the strapped crew. It says that laird hamilton and dave kalama are the onlt two apart of the crew, but there are about 10 more surfers in the actual crew. I have to say that also the guy who made this film did not do it very well. I mean you would expect Bruce Browns's son to make a better surf movie than this. (Bruce Brown made one of the best surf films of all time ""The Endless Summer"" series. Sorry but the person who made this film should know more about surfing before they make a film on it."
1,"Victorinox vs Leatherman . I have been a long time user of many tools from both companies and appreciate both of them equally. I mainly purchased this tool because I had not had a Leatherman in a long time.Another reason for going with this tool is I needed something I could carry in my pocket clipped. My Victorinox Swisstool Spirit doesn't have a clip on it and I'm not one to carry a pouch on my belt just to carry my tool. I have to dress professional at work and having a tool clipped inside my pocket is a little more subtle in my opinion.It has a different feel than my Swiss but I can already see how amazing it will be. The Swiss is beautiful, well layed out, smooth, and shiny where the Leatherman Charge TTi just looks mean. The blades on the Leatherman are wicked and the best they offer. Tools are a bit more out of the way but I love the one hand operation blades that I don't get on anything Victorinox that I have."
0,"DO NOT BUY - AVOID THESE PEOPLE . These people are not to be dealt with.They are liars:The write up says, ""Set includes a 38"" square table and four comfortable, high-back chairs"". When you order this, it will not arrive with chairs, and the company will offer no apology.They supply damaged materials:We ordered 2 tables. One was quite smashed.They have terrible customer service:So far it is 2 months after I have sent back the table, and still I have not received my credit."
1,"Great winter ""beach read"" . Fun read, endearing (although unrealistic) characters, interesting plot twists. A great winter beach read!"
1,"Undiluted Truth, a Molotov Cocktail - . This book is like a Bible for dissidents. I've felt mentally and morally sick working in higher education for close to ten years now and just thought I was crazy. Gatto confirms that it is the system itself which is sick and that the people who run it and benefit are not honest and honorable people and one could fairly label them pathological, I'll even label them as pedophiles for raping the minds, spirits and souls of students. It's rare to see a man speak so truthfully and forcefully and passionately about what is missing today; honor, principle, character, creativity, imagination, independence, and dissent. I'm amazed this man hasn't been assassinated for exposing this dirty game. This book goes way beyond the narrow scope of education, he taps into a world view and value system which is heartening for me, he helps me understand why and how the world is so screwed up. This man should run for president in my opinion"
1,my dog loves . I have a 30 lb terrier mix rescue. I got this 1 year ago and still in one piece. It is hard plastic so if you have ceramic or hardwood floors it is loud. It does take time for the dog to learn how to get food out. It took my dog an hour or so. I would highly recommend. But always supervise dogs with toys especially when it is new.
1,"the decline and fall of the Barnes collection . This is a detailed description of the folly of Mr. Barnes, thinking he could micromanage his multi-billion art collection from beyond the grave. The collection now is in good hands. 'The art of the steal' it is not."
0,"Deliver Us from Untalented, Egomaniacal Sean... . Sorry to be rough on you Sean, but, after reading ""Deliver Us From Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism,"" I have to ask - who told you that you could write? That person is not your friend. As with your radio show, the book is filled with empty anecdotes, circular logic and outright lies. And, despite its obvious shortcomings, I stuck it out and read it from cover to cover, hoping for a payout so at least the four hours of my life weren't wasted. That payout never came. Well, at least I can get 75% of the cost back when I sell it used on Amazon.com. So I'm out, what, 4 hours and 4 bucks? Oh well, it could be worse - I could've read your other book, too..."

0,Pure nonsense . You only need to read the jacket copy to know that this book is nothing but a tired rehash of failed creationist arguments. Reading the book doesn't do anything to change this perception. Read Richard Dawkins instead.
0,Not what I wanted . These sweatpants were thinner than I expected and they also did not fit well around my waist. They have the one looped cord in the elastic and I find that those don't work as well as one cord split that you can tie.
0,"Did not work for us . I have purchased Gripe Water, And other products for our baby and her Colic issues and i never saw any improvements with that so i figure i would give this a shot. No noticeable difference at all with these Colic tabs. Normally i love Hylands products, but these did not work for us at all."
0,"Waste of $10 . Look carefully at the details on this book before you buy. It's tiny. I mean, really tiny. Think ""Little Golden Books"" tiny. Don't waste your money on this - even as a new father gift. It's worth $3 at most. The text itself is mildly amusing, brief, and mostly accurate."
1,Nikon TC-E15ED . You'd better have tripod ready when purchased this telescope. It's powerful zoom factor 420 mm(equal 35 mm camera). In order to get a good picture from this telescope you must learn how to control exposure and speed shot. It's an excellent tool for Nikon Coolpix 5700.
1,"Opening chapter to what may be the best epic ever. . The only reason I don't give this book four stars is that it takes about 100 pages to get into, quite a bit for a 400-odd page book, until you consider that it is really a ~6500 page epic divided into 20 chapters. This epic is life, neatly set out in black type, and anyone with a life today will appriciate how similar it is to life 200 years ago. A note of caution, though: if you get through those first hundred pages, you may not be able to put these works down until you've read all twenty volumes."
0,"Heavy hearted reader . As a great fan of Patricia Cornwell, I anxiously await each of her new books, and so it is with a heavy heart that I write this review. This is a horribly written book filled with a cast of unbelievable, bumbling idiots. There is not one intelligent character in this book - nor is there any redeeming feature about this book.What a disappointment. As a reader, I feel angry and insulted that Ms. Cornwell thought this book would be enjoyable to anyone. What a tremendous waste of time: hers as an author, yours as a reader.Message to Ms. Cornwell: Give your readers some credit for having some intelligence.Question for Ms. Cornwell: Why in the world would you write a book like this and then actually allow it to be published?Message to Patricia Cornwell fans: DON'T buy this book - it's a waste of your money and a waste of your time.I gave this book one star only because that is the lowest number allowed. If given the choice, I would rate it a zero."
1,"THE STORY OF THE YEAR . This just not any story to do with chickens, it is the story where it disribes the true life of chicken (if the could think and talk). The carecters are so funny the way they talk walk look. i would really recomend this for anybody. If you are depresed for any reson o your are happy watch this movie it is one of the best short movies this year. The only thing wrong about it is that it isn't wallace and gromit but any way it is still a good movie."
1,This is a great Fan . A great value. Set-up outside on a back porch to provide a cool breeze in the summertime and it works great.
0,"Nick, where has your charm gone??? . I am a sucker for good romantic stories - however, A Walk to Remember is a disappointing third book by Sparks. The characters are shallow and the story is so predictable (if you have read the first two Sparks' novels). The lines are repeated time and time again to bring out the readers' emotions and none of the sentiments touched me deeply ... I'm sorry to say that the book was written to popularize tissue papers. Sparks tried to please the readers too much that he lost the charm that he had so deeply in ""The Notebook"". Please Nicholas, bring back your charm from ""The Notebook"" and stop trying to please the readers ... The Notebook is the best of his novels so far."
0,"Slow start -- good middle -- lousy ending . This book was a major disappointment. The author seems todrone on and on about ordinary happenings without providing any pointor revelance to the overall story line. I plodded through the last 100 or so pages hoping for an ending that would tie everything together or at least be a happy one for Trudi. Instead, the book just sort of petered out. I was very disappointed and felt like reading this book was a huge waste of my time. I guess I just didn't get it."
0,My First Golf Book . The binding on the book was broken - pages could easily be pulled from the hard cover. A child's name was written on the back inside cover. I would not characterize this book as being in good shape. Very disappointing.
0,"Read the reviews before you buy . As the previous reviews pointed out, most of these are not the original recordings and definitely not worth the money. I would give it 0 stars if I could."
1,"Maybe a little too informative. . Good for details, much of which I'll never use. Many shortcuts I'll probably never remember, and programs I'll never use. However easy to understand and get a feel for the various programs. Nice useful product, more informative than I needed or expected."
0,"I resent what this implies! . Wait just a chicken flickin' minute! What is Amazon trying to say about me that this shows up in my Gold Box with the claim that it's been selected ""just for me?"" It doesn't take a detective to figure out what they're seeming to imply, here.Sure, there's probably a good doctoral thesis for someone in many of my issues, but I don't need a big doorstop of a book to self-diagnose actual disorders. Well, more of them, anyway."
1,"Highly Recommended . This recording of the fabulous grand concertos by Corelli is one of the best recordings that I own. These concertos should not be taken for granted; they set a precedent for the Concerti grossi by Handel, Geminiani, and many others.I Musici employs their impeccable technique, tone, articulation, and dynamics in this recordings. Philips held up their part of the deal; the sound quality on the recording is unbelievable. No other recording that I own is as crisp and clean as this recording is. A must buy for fans of baroque music."
0,"Terrible crayons-Don't understand other reviews! . I bought these crayons for my daughter based off of the very good reviews they received from other people. I honestly can't even begin to understand WHY people say such good things about crayons. They are NOT durable...maybe they are more durable then the thinnest Crayola crayon but certainly not the jumbo crayons. The color is so light and barely there, it's not fun for young children. The crayons feel weird and are not at all like the color of the actual crayon when the color is on paper. These are the worst crayons I think we've ever used and that includes cheap crayons you get at a restaurant for kids to color with. I usually love Melissa and Doug but I am HIGHLY disappointed with these crayons."
0,"I was disappointed . When I purchased this book I couldn't wait to get it in the mail. I was SO excited about learning about how to ""eat"" for womb health but what I came across was a lot of reference to some healthy womb god idol? I don't know, I was very put off by the constant references to this idol god, and womb circle chants that she suggest we do? I thought I would be able to take from it what I could use, and discard everything else but the references were too frequent, and it put a really bad taste in my mouth, I felt I was being exposed to things that were very oddly relgious, (non-christian) and I am not interested in that. I purchased the book in hopes that I'd learn to eat a certain way for an overall healthy womb, but got a lot of other weird stuff, that made me uneasy, I couldn't finish the book."
1,"Lovely Book! . I am a big Tudor fan & love the artwork in this lovely book! I've also tried two of the recipes, so far, & thought they were terrific!"
1,It's a Keeper . I would recommend this game to anyone... but I have to say that there's a couple of disappointments i've run into in comparison to previous FIFA Soccer Versions.. in FIFA 2003 I learned that there isn't a Create-A-Player mode in the game which I find disappointing another is gameplay might be too hard for beginners although I'm trying not to be negative this is an awesome game certaintly one of EA Sports best. just those two things disappoint me for some reason but I won't be returning it I'll defenitly enjoy this awesome title !
1,"Chopstir . If it were made of silicone, it wouldn't get melted and ruined on the tips. I like how it works, though. :)"
1,"A combination of sexy and smooth to the ears grooves . I was debating if I should buy this compilation for the fear of being let down, but I did. I definitely don't regret it. Usually I skip to songs that I enjoy, but driving long distances I noticed that I didn't skip any songs. Very satisfied with my purchased. Some of my favorite tracks include tracks 1.Don't Look Back - Dual Sessions and 7.Insane[Beach Love Mix]"
1,"Great starting off point for new bank board members . Benton Gup gives a very thorough overview of the role of a bank board member and the importance of understanding the major elements that make up a modern financial institution.It is important to note that this is a starter book; if you are currently a bank board member, or contemplating becoming one, you should understand that this book will spur you to further study on major subjects in other books and formats."
0,"dont buy it! . Dont buy it! I used it for 2 weeks and it worked just fine -- was able to get 4 oz within 7 minutes, then all of the sudden, it stopped working. It would still pull at my nipple but nothing would come out -- I would constantly have to readjust the sheild to get more. I called customer service and they said that it was a lactation issue but with another pump I have no problems. DONT GET IT! Buy a hands-free one so that you can walk around the house - you dont want to be tied down to the machine."
0,Noisy Zurich Automatic Watch Winder . The Zurich Time Single Automatic Watch Winder keeps my watch wound but its motor is very noisy. I cannot keep it in my bedroom or it keeps me awake. This is not a quiet winder!
1,"12 years of trouble-free use . I have had a set of these Novi 4-channel wireless intercoms for over 12 years. Mine are set up on different wiring circuits in my current home, and they work just fine. I'm not sure why other people are having trouble with them not working on different wiring circuits. One caution: I used to live in a condo, and, apparently, one of the neighbors received a set as a Christmas present, because we began to hear their conversations the day after Christmas. We just switched channels, no more problems."
0,DONT WASTE TIME . What started out as a page turner ended up just being boring. Dont be fooled there is no way this book should be rated 4 stars
1,"Classicly lovely and great for baby's vision . Not only is this a simple, timeless, unisex looking mobile, but it is also great for the development of a baby's vision. Whereas some mobiles function moreso to match decor, other mobiles are educational attachments to the crib. Keep in mind that pastel colors are not appreciated by infants for months. The panda bear was the first animal seen by my infant b/c of the black and white. The primary colors of Blue Jean Teddy then become noticed. The green gingham pattern on the dog and the softer hued duck were spotted after further development. My baby is now a sitter and she still likes to look at the panda the most. The only con of this mobile is the wind-up music box. I would have preferred a battery-operated one so that it can play as long as I and my baby wanted. But the reasonable price of this mobile AS WELL as the cute look of it made it a great buy. Educational baby products don't have to look weird!"
1,"Satisfied . The RoadMate gets the job done. It isn't the sleekest or smallest GPS but it will get you from A to B, at a very affordable price. The only issue I have faced with the RoadMate so far, is the cost of map updates (around $50.00), but I haven't needed it yet."
1,fantastic album... I WANT MORE!!! . This is a great album i was recently introduced to. After doing a bit of searching i found that Baxter has put out several albums since this one in 1998. Anyone know where one might buy these other albums? Id appreciate any help. Thanks
1,"A great read following the lines of the Da Vinci Code! . This novel was absolutely amazing. It follows in the lines of Dan Brown's novel, but has a different twist so it makes the two novels different. Shoeles is an amazing storyteller with a flair for twists that will keep the reader guessing until the very end of the novel! I highly recommend this novel for anyone who loved the Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons!"
0,"I was disappointed in this sequel. . Even though I enjoyed this book, I found that it lacked continuity with Robert O'Brien's original book, ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH."" The book was an easier read, but it doesn't have the detail that the first book had. I read both aloud to my students. My students all said they liked the original book better."
1,"Spellbinding But Deceptive . Perhaps I have become desensitized, but I found the novel to be misleading; Cook spends a great deal of time foreshadowing a tragic, haunting event that ends up seeming anticlimactic; I expected something far more sinister. The preview outshines the work itself. I did enjoy reading it, however; Cook's style is soft, understated, and utterly mesmerizing, perfect for late night reading. His style flows and drifts into the subconscious; it's alluring prose, even if it leads to a less than riveting conclusion."
0,"Communist Blockheads. . Mr. Brzezinski feels that America must be replaced as a global village. How I and 250 million other people disagree must be beyond his puny immagination. A one-world governemnt is easier to conquer and force socialism by making the Global Community ""hell on earth"" where only a few thousands engineers run a billion slaves. Zbiginiew, The Trilateral Commission founder and member and long time anti-american elitest and CFR member I have one question. How did a clown like you ever land a job as Professor of John Hopkins University?"
1,Love it . This feeder is made of heavy duty materials that last- I was happy to find one to add to one I had for 8+ years.I like that you can take the bowls out and wash them. For me sometimes my cats want to eat alone and I can just take them apart for seperate feeding.
0,"brutal, brutally inadequate contemptible work of garbage . Its like the fan boys who talked in superlatives about Planet Terror, and the fan base of sci-fi lemmings on amazon who salivate at edgy, whino-college gutter films like, the ever hyped, and truly disappointing Cloverfield.Kill Bill is just a Jackie Chan film going artsy. It's just art-house on Meth; its ludicrous, which is probably what it is supposed to be from jump street, but I have had enough of Scream acerebral thinking. I am sure it is boat loads of fun working with Quentin. There obviously is a reason movies like this are made. Five stars indeed. I'd rather watch reruns of Ghandi and a marathon on AMC of awful Clint Eastwood films like Unforgiven, then to ever, EVER sit through a Quentin film again.If this is the kind of raw new talent coming from Hollywood in that era, I certainly have a chance to bring my ideas to fruition."
0,"So bad I shipped it back . The music all by itself is all right, but it's ruined by Serrano's lyrics, which are at best, self-absorbed and adolescent, and at worst, just plain sick. Perhaps there are people who don't mind songs about everything from suicide thoughts to pedophilic desires, but as for me, COUNT ME OUT! I removed the CD from the player after the pedophilia song and returned it to Amazon in disgust without even listening to the rest of the CD. I was so grossed out, I don't even care whether or not I get my money back, I just wanted that thing out of my house! Yuck!"
1,"Brian Wilson-""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"" . A stunning yet disturbing portait of a true musical genius. Paul and John had eachother, Brian had only himself, with little group participation other than critisism. This powerful documentary proves, through all his struggles, his music will last forever."
1,"Couple of strange reviews below . I don't think MTV came within fifty miles of this band. A couple of the reviews below make me wonder if somebody's working out a personal grudge...Anyway, Toreador is a solid, uptempo, melodic indie rock album by one of the many creative Northwest bands to find themselves trapped at the tail end of the ""grunge"" era. Songs like ""Comet"" and ""Shiva"" are fun, frenetic numbers with a sardonic undertone. One of the best albums of all time? No, of course not. But a good reminder that the Pacific Northwest in the 1990s spawned a lot of quality bands that shouldn't be folded into some one-dimensional ""grunge scene."" Buy it, put it on when you want to feel energized and sing along a little."
1,"A noteworthy success. . A clever, original, and satisfying manipulation of science-fictiontopoi, Mark Wakely's An Audience for Einstein is a realachievement."
1,"This is one of my go-to books. . I absolutely love this book. Originally, I found it and checked it out my campus library. I found it so inspirational and helpful for my design work that I had to buy a copy of my own. It is great for people who are really interested in typography."
0,"Mac OS X yes, $130 no . Mac OS X is great. No disputing that. Jaguar was a real step forward. I was glad to pay $130 for that. Panther... well, Apple claims 150 great new features... but there's really only a handful that are useful... and it's a little much for them to ask for $130 again just 1 year later.Great product, but not worth the cost."
0,"One star is actually much too generous. . Don't waste your money. David Allen Grier was so funny when he performed on In Living Color, but I now know it's because he was great at supporting roles. When left alone, this comedian leaves alot to desire. The DVD is not good and his stand up routine is just awful. We saw him last night for New Years Eve in Atlantic City. Hard to believe he is the same guy. He had a ""warm up"" comedian come on before him who was hilarious. Don't spend any money on stand up or DVD's for him. You will be dissapointed. No chance here to give no stars. If I could have, I would have."
1,"affordable challenging fun . This is an amazingly fun and energetic plane. Recommend launching via the direct-toss (as a paper plane) with motors humming.Teaches kids about relative speeds--takeoff and land into the wind, etc.Expect some crashes on first day out, but for the right age it'll be great by the end of the first flight day. I'm enjoying watching this as much as my boy is thrilled flying it!"
0,"Is this the worst comp sci book at Amazon ? . An appalling book.Boring, poorly written, poorly edited.Try Algorithm design manual by Steven S. Skiena or Thomas H.

0,"Confusing, and at times inaccurate . I used this book for an online class, books and test are bundled together and each time I took the test I had to challenge at lest one question, because it was simply wrong or inaccurate. Test quiz/test questions are non constructive for the most part. Many examples use non-standard fonts that hard to find, making assignments unnecessarily difficult to complete, in some exercises after following all instructions the correct result would not match the examples given again creating difficulty not needed. This books suited for online classes because it often gives instructions which are completely irrelevant in such environment. The books gives a good amount of tips and tricks about MS Office, books needs revising and grouping of lessons."

1,"Squirrel ""Pruf"" feeder . The feeder has less capacity than it seemed and is not completely squirrel proof. It is sturdy, attractive, and better than most at keeping pests at bay. The birds seem to like it better than the feeder it replaced. I plan to buy one more for the front yard."
1,"Innovative . Finally, an instrumental cd that allows dj's to mix withouthaving to buy the single to every popular hip hop song just toget the instrumental. Hopefully more will come."
0,"Worse than Godzilla . This is the worst hyped movie I have ever seen. There is none of the Star Wars magic in this film. None of the characters in the film are sympathetic and Jar Jar is the worst creation in the history of film. Buying this movie is like telling George Lucas that it is okay to make a billion dollar movie with an awful script. The worst thing about this movie is that the computer special effects are the real star and there is no humanity or soul in the film. Star Wars was a great movie because it had characters people could relate to, but this movie has none. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS WORTHLESS MOVIE."
0,This was the UK Version and doesn't play on my TV! . I was so excited that I finally found this movie and when I put it in my DVD player it said that it couldn't play so I tried my Xbox..still didn't work. After trying several other units I was unable to get it to play as it is the UK version of the film and does not work in the states. I am very disappointed with this purchase. It was a waste of my money and time waiting for it to get here. I can't even watch it.
1,"Very nice, and a good value for money . I have been using these for about an year now, and they are the best ones under $40 that I've owned. Here are some plus points:1. very sturdy metal band resulting in a snug fit2. compact enough to be carried around, without loss in the bass! :)Just be careful not to open the headphones holding the plastic parts - they may break. The best way is to hold the metal band and pull them apart. A very good buy, and highly recommended.-Amarendra"
0,"You get what you pay for. . Usually I use Merkur blades, but I saw these available and figured, ""I'm sure they'll be fine."" The blades felt dull; they were flimsy, and a couple of the blades in the pack had grime on them when I opened them. My skin was irritated like never before and I got more small cuts than I had from my safety razor since...well, ever, really. Immediately, I hopped on Amazon and ordered a pack of the Merkur blades."
0,Not that fun . I bought this for a 9yr old boy thinking it would be fun due to all the positive reviews. It was the most boring magic set I've ever seen. The tricks are silly. I think he played with it out of obligation but has never touched it again. Melissa and Doug usually make great toys but I think maybe they should stick to entertaining the smaller children.
0,"Do NOT get this toy . Similar to all the other reviewers, the voice transmission *never* worked on this toy. For some reason, the morse code would be transmitted/received, but the whole point of the toy is the 'talkie' part and this toy does not 'workie', so do not bother getting."
0,"Catalina doesn't ruin girls; it makes ruined girls smarter . While Catalina can be at times a stressful environment, King's experience here can only be attributed to her own insecurities. Catalina is an incredibly strong academic school and the faculty here do everything in their power to help students do well. King obviously didn't have the natural ability or drive to succeed that is needed to flourish here, as shown by the fact that the writing in this book would not have recieved a passing grade in my freshman english class."

0,"Very dry history . I was very excited when i bought this book since i am from the Caribbean.However i was disappointed with it. The authors way of telling the story is very dry and sometimes hard to follow.On several parts of the book i found myself trying to read fast so i can get to the real interesting parts. I believe that the author relies too much on the economics of the region while avoiding telling us important events and information on the region.For example he never tells us why the islands were named with the names that they have today.Why Cuba? Where doest it come from? Why Antigua? Why Martinique? Sometimes this book reads like an economics report which makes it very dull and boring at times.I guess the author assumes you know most of the story.Again, very dull and dry history on a region that is full of history and action."
0,"Terrible! . I bought one of these from a local store thinking I could take care of some light body hair that I had.This thing didn't do anything but mess my hair up. Here is what I mean...I thought..cool! I will test this bad boy out. I tried to trim some hair on my wrist to test it out. It just pushed my hair around. I took off the rounded foil cutter and did a straight cut from the blade. Even trying that method took too much effort to cut hair.I also thought since it was advertised as a wet/dry that maybe it did better wet. Again..same results. Needless to say, I returned it within a day of buying it."

0,"Fun, but mostly fiction . This book is a fun read for fans of W.C. Fields. But accuracy was not a major issue for the author. Many of the stories have since been disproven by better biographers who bothered to do some research. The author here just accepted all of Fields's gag stories and the output of Paramount's publicity department.This book can be enjoyed, but it should be regarded as a work of fiction that loosely touches on some aspects of the reality of Fields's life.If you want an actual biographer of Fields, you'd do much better with Simon Louvish."
1,Fun game true to the anime . I played this game years ago on the Sega Saturn with my cousin's two kids. They were both as in love with the characters and game play as I was. It wasn't the most challenging of games but the humor and cut scenes made it well worth it.We ended up getting into both the anime and manga because of how much we enjoyed the story. Its a shame you can't get this game for less money but if you can find it for less definitely get it. It was a great ending for a beloved console. Wish I still had this game and my Sega Saturn.
0,"Not hot enough, controller gets hot . At the highest setting, the warmest my skin gets is 105F. That's not warm enough to do any good. The controller gets almost as hot at 100F. I have an old heating heating pad that reaches 110F on the middle setting, which is warm enough to do some good."
1,WICKED WIDOW . I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR EACH NEW BOOK BY AMANDA QUICK TO BE PUBLISHED. AM AN AVID FAN. ALTHO THIS ONE IS NOT AS GOOD AS SOME OF HER OTHERS. ie.MISCHIEF--AFFAIR STILL ALL IN ALL HER LADIES ALL LEND A BREATH OF FRESH AIR TO THE REGENCY PERIOD. HER LOVE SCENES ARE BELIEVABLE AND HER MEN ARE RATHER NICE EVEN WHEN PROVEN THAT THEY ARE NOT THE ANSWER TO EVERY MAIDENS PRAYERS. I LIKE IT WHEN THE BAD AND REALLY BAD GUYS GET THEIR JUST REWARDS. ALSO THE STREET CHILDREN ARE TREATED WITH RESPECT AND KINDNESS. ALL IN ALL A GOOD BOOK.
0,"Some good content, hidden behind impossibly bad writing . A few helpful nuggets, strewn randomly across almost 500 pages of rambling natterings. Comically poorly written book. Seems like the author did some excellent research on a worthy topic, but then felt the key findings were too light to monetize, and decided to stretch a very finite set of insights and suggestions that could easily fit on a couple of pages across (multiple!) tedious filibuster books. It pleased me to see the cheap newspaper stock of this incoherent tome disintegrate in my fireplace."
1,Tools for Dad . I bought this for my Father and he loved it. I was very happy the package came on time for Father's Day. I would buy from this seller again.
1,"Haunting and beautiful . This is my favorite Cure album. Some people have called this album depressing and morbid, but I love it - it's cathartic! It takes me to another world. How many artists can do that? Everything about this work is gorgeous. I can't live without it!"
1,"This is Great American Literature at it's finest! . Fortunately, fifteen years (or more) ago, I read this book on my own before my English teacher required it... this is not a book that needs to be analysed and charted. It is one that needs to be absorbed, and felt. It does NOT deserve to be one of those books students hate merely because it's required reading.The characters are as real as books get, the small town one that you might live in now, or your grandparents might have lived in decades ago. The issues - from racism, sibling relationships, and just plain growing up - touch your soul. And it's just plain fun to read.It's a bit of American culture that should be cherished... passed on as the valuable art it is - but to tear it apart with attempts to read into symbolism, or to over analyze it... that nearly denies Harper Lee the respect she deserves for writing it."
1,finding your purpose as a mom . This book was bought as part of a Bible Study group and we are finding it very helpful in keeping us focused on providing Christ centered homes for our families.
0,"Absolute Junk . This fryer worked great while it lasted. After a year the interlocking electric cord would no longer connect properly, so it wouldn't turn on. After replacing the cord, the unit worked for another year and then quit working completely. Fryer handle has a tendency to keep falling in the fryer, thereby melting the plactic into a twisted horrible fashion.Steer clear of this dud."
1,"Fun, but not for FOUR . I got this nerf gun for my son who is 4.5. He is not big enough to cock this gun to shoot it. I got one for him and for dad, we played with them when the kids went to bed. Very fun, I want to get bigger ones just for me and daddy, but I need to get a smaller one that our son can work himself."
0,"A Picture Book . I bought this and ""Waiting for Baby"" for my son when I was expecting his first sibling. I was unhappily surprised to find they did not have words, just pictures. That definitely should be part of the product description.It isn't too hard to make up a story, but if I would have known it was lacking words I never would have bought it."
1,"Very nice . It works fast. Mineral deposits on the bottom, but not a big problem to clean. It is actually boiling water, not just heating it and also turning off at correct time. I have it for around 2 years. Works fine."
1,"Art Repros Worth Hanging . The Taschen Posterbooks are of excellent quality. The six Van Gogh's given us here, for a very low price, are a nicely representative group. Primarily the most impressive factor is the accuracy with which the colors are reproduced. Having seen many in person, I am very critical of prints with poor to pathetic truth in color. We like them to the point of hanging all 6 in our home. The images are of the cafe at Arles-night, lane with cypresses, one of the sunflowers, one self-portrait, the bridge at Langlois and of course, the bedroom at Arles.Regardless the amount of money you have to spend, definitely buy this little jewel as an adjunct. Or if you are tightly budgeted, what a buy!"

0,"The perfume seems to be very old . Once I opened the box, I found that the color seemed to be weird. After, I taste the essence, I found that it was completely different compared with my old one. Therefore I think it was an old perfume. Lastly, I had to travel the next day, so I keep my perfume."
0,Too Big . It's okay - it does give you plenty of writing space but if you want convenience then Save your money - invest in a laptop.
1,"give it a chance . It is confusing for the first few chapters, and I occasionally had to stop and think about the time schemes... but it is incredibly worth it in the end. This is a wonderful love story with, for once, an original concept. It's very well written... I'm surprised this is the author's first book - many of the passages are just so beautifully constructed. Sure, there might be a few plot holes, but they are not important. If the reader does not understand some things, it is because the characters don't either; any confusion simply further conveys the essense of Henry's feeling that he has little control over his life, and Clare's fear that she will lose him."

When i researched (apparently not well enough), and got this 2-4 cup Farberware perc, i couldn't have been happier...after using a mr coffee, this coffee was HOT, and delicious and didn't take long....a couple months ago, it blew the GFI plug, and i thought it was someone else's a/c or something...well, it did it three days in a row this week....it no longer works, cuts off before it's done, blows the circuit and therefore, brown water...i'm so disappointed...and now, 20-20 hindsight, i'm reading the one star and two star reviews and see that this is a common element (no pun intended)..amazon, stop selling this piece of crap, please...i love to order everything from you, and always look to amazon first, but this is such a widespread issue with farberware, you should give them the boot..thanks"
1,What an excellent story. . I read it over the summer after my boyfriend finished it. To be honest there were some things in the story that surprised me. I thought that the story would have been a little different. I thought some things were also unbelievable but nothing off the charts outrageous. It was long but I was glad because it gave me something to look forward to everyday for a long time. I was entertained by this book.
0,"Not for the long run . I am an avid loose tea user, but I feel like an idiot after the tea ball came apart into 4 pieces (the 2 mesh halves plus the chain and the clasp for the side). For the life of me, I cannot get it to seal the way it is supposed to. I am ready to invest in a much higher quality infuser basket that is just 2 pieces at the most and a no-brainer to use. I am the mother of four; I like things simple and reliable :)"
1,"If You Don't Own This Then What Are You Waiting On? . This is essential jazz. Everything Max Roach and Clifford Brown did together was a solid 5-star affair. You would be crazy to think otherwise. It doesn't get much better than this folks.Clifford Brown - trumpetMax Roach - drumsHarold Land - tenor saxophoneRichie Powell - piano (Bud Powell's brother)George Morrow - bassI don't see the need in writing long reviews on recordings that don't need any convincing. This is one of them. Either you're a jazz fan or you're not. If you don't own ""Brown And Roach, Inc,"" then you're not."
1,"raw & inventive . Think of this album as a genius engineer building a masterfully powerful machine...out of an erector set. 'Selling Live Water' has powerful, very raw and clangy, beats. Sole's voice is that of anger, frustration, and insight, but overall you can really here a guy having fun. He creates incredible lines without using any proper rhyme scheme; his formula is to be dead on with the beats, and at that he is incredible. While Sole's rapping skills cannot be argued with, I must say that the beats are the star of the album. Of all the hip-hop albums to emerge lately this one is 2nd only to El-P's 'Fantastic Damage'. Exceptional songs include 'Da Baddest Poet', 'Salt on Everything', and 'Plutonium'."
0,"Item is discontinued . I experienced similar problems that others have described. The charger will stay on charge all day long but give only a few minutes worth of extra power to the NDS when switched to play mode. It also gets noticeably warm, almost hot, in that center battery area while in play mode.I called NYKO for support and was informed that the item has been discontinued. There is no other similar product offered by the company for the NDS. I was offered a measure of credit towards any other product on their web site but the only items for NDS amounted to a light-up stylus and a camouflage carrying case with a matching car charger. Hardly a replacement for a charger grip that would have been amazing for that upcoming 11-hour overseas flight.So I'm out ten bucks because the retailer has no more for exchange. I can either hack the device to try to fix the battery or take a chance wasting another ten bucks for a possible working device. Now where's that tri-blade screwdriver?"
0,"Could not get through it . I'm sorry, I just couldn't stay awake reading this thing. It was confusing, boring, and annoying. I had high hopes when picking it up: I like historical fiction, I like reading about science and scientists, and I've generally found Irish writers (at least those available in the US) to be to my liking.Skip this one."
1,"An Excellent Resource That Does Not Bore You To Tears . When I ordered the Encyclopedia, I resigned myself to slugging through mountains of information and end up ""What did that say again?""Well, I am pleased to say that there was the mountain of information and more often than not I knew what it was saying. The definitions in were to the point, crisp and relevant to the times. Rev. P. Stravinskas had the insight to include information an ordinary Catholic needed at 7PM Sunday in a mad rush to complete an assignment.Where the encyclopedia lost me were in some definitions that were necessarily lengthy. Obviously, some white space could have saved me time in re-reading the whole passage. But, with the value of the information included, I believe the Encyclopedia is an excellent resource for those of us who are not scholars in the catechism of the Catholic Church."
0,This book is opinion . I am not for or against drinking but the author of this book comes across as a drunk that is against prohibition. Aside from repeatedly stating that it stripped our rights to drink it really didn't say anything. Glad it was free

The Cafe Piel was good...the ending was a bit unrealistic, but the storyline was good. The short story by Channing was awful...I could not finish reading it...I did not know where he was going with the story...this story is why I rate the book a 4 and not a five."
0,"I cannot believe... . I cannot believe that people would give this film 5 stars.

0,NEVER WORKED . My machine wouldnt recognize the card. Total waste of my money. I have the new slim PSTwo machine... I DO NOT recommend this to anyone. Do yourself a favor and just buy the regular memory cards.
1,"The title is an oxymoron, but they did a good job of making it simple . I actually really like this book, but I think you do need the extra guidance of a professor when using it. It's very easy to look up the pharmaceuticals and all related info, and I was actually able to use it easily when taking the open book section (looking up the pharms) of a pharmacotherapeutics test. I would definitely recommend this book."
1,Shipping flaw . I was excited to order this for my 10 month old grand son. When I received it I was a bit disappointed. Although the toy seems nice and I am sure that he will love it but it is supposed to be a Christmas gift. It did not come in its own box. The shipping box is not in the best shape. I have to go find a box to wrap it in. How come in does not have a box of its own. I do not want them to think that I bought a used one!! I have no idea what to do!!!
0,"Hilarious and ridiculous . ...to even think of blaming libraries. Maybe if high powered political figures on library boards across America didn't feel the need to make their served institutions ""All Things to All People"" and got back to core values, and if the American public could turn off American Idol and reality TV long enough to end the Reign of the Retard, there would be the support for libraries needed to house all the items ever published anywhere, and every Podunktown can have it's own Library of Congress. Guess you've truly made it when you've sold enough books you can bite a hand that feeds you, Mr. Baker.However that does not detract from the quality of his writing, stellar as usual."
1,"A Journey Well Worth The Effort . If you are familiar with the characters Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, there is really no mystery here. But, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself. Connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined. We are not given large doses of non-essential information just to prolong the story, as happens with quite a few other authors these days. We learn a little more about Harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook. A journey well worth the effort."
1,"Loved it. . I couldn't wait to see how it ended. (To me, it was more a book where I wanted to know how it ended, rather than just drinking in the current part of the story - it really pulled me along). Once it did, I'm sorry that it's over. It's in my head now - I keep thinking I can go pick up my book and read, then I remember I finished it, and my heart sinks a little each time."
1,"Great reading . While Patton had flaws, and they are clearly presented in this excellently-written biography, I found his story full of high interest and one could not help but feel glad that Patton was present when he was on the battlefields where he served. This is an excellent work, well matching the other D'Este works I have read: Decision in Normandy (read 5 July 1992) and Fatal Decision (read 29 June 2003). Patton did heroic things but there is no need to admire his flaws--and that includes his belief that crude and foul language somehow made him a better man and general, and that he thought he knew more about mental damage than doctors. But this is a great and enjoyable book to read and I revelled in it."

0,"Does not live up to the hype. . After reading this book for my October bookclub meeting, I was hard pressed to find out what all the hype about this book was about. While there were aspects of the book that were thought provoking, I failed to see the merit this book supposedly has. I also found myself wondering why his conversation was worth publishing. I found it interesting that on many occasions when the book got boring, which it often did, I could jump around and not lose a beat....that's not saying much. In the end, I just did not like the book very much, again, aspects of it were thought provoking, but all in all I'd not highly reccomend this book. The Road Less Traveled was better."

0,"Not adequate . Bought these for my two adult chins. The male is tiny, but he was somewhat cramped in it and only used this until I added a fleece house - now he only uses this for a platform. It's also not heavy or stable enough for them to use as a platform - on shavings it will tip slightly and startle them when they jump on it. Additionally, they jump on it with enough force that the top comes off daily, so eventually I had to nail it down so they wouldn't fall on it awkwardly.The female is much longer than the male, and she looked really uncomfortable in this whenever she had to turn around in it. She too abandoned it, and I didn't even give her an alternate nest box.I know the price is attractive, but now I have two houses that I'm going to pull out and replace with more substantial, large boxes. I definitely don't recommend this house type at all."
0,"Nice design, BAD tracking . I really liked the form factor and features of this unit, and was excited to have my first truly wireless mouse for my recent 12"" Powerbook purchase. Unfortunately, I found the response time lagging slightly and cursor tracking not as smooth or as fast as my Macally iOpti Jr. mouse, so (ultimately) it proved unsatisfactory. I also found problems with having to continually go back into the Bluetooth Pref in order to wake the mouse after the computer went to sleep and was re-activated, but did not pursue a fix since the performance was sub-par anyhow. I have returned this, and will try someone else's Bluetooth mouse until I find one the responds as well as a USB mouse (or give up entirely)."
0,"frustrated to the MAX . I bought this RCT3 soaked because my son loves RCT3 so much. As soon as I installed it, it crashed both the Soaked and the original RCT3. Neither would work again. I was getting 'bad version 4 ' error and asking me to install a disk I already had installed . There is NO customer support for Atari games! No one answers their phone and no one responds to my e-mails. It is trash."

0,"Great TV - Service Terrible . Bought this from Amazon in March 2006. It worked for a few days then died. To make a long story short it took Panasonic 3 months to resolve the situation. They finally ended up buying the TV back. Usually I have had good luck ordering electronics through Amazon, but remember you can't send big TV's back to Amazon even if it breaks a few days after buying (this policy was disclosed when I purchased the TV so I am not complaining about this, only Panasonics Service). I took the refund and bought an LCD TV direct from a prominent computer maker. They have an advance exchange service policy which is a better option for this kind of purchase."

1,awesome . it is so nice to have filtered hot and cold water - i use it every day - the filter was so heavy when I removed the old one to put the new one on.
1,HIC Porcelain Set of 3 Mortar and Pestle White . I love this set. I have used the small one to crush pills I have also used the large one to make small amounts of mayo with garlic or shallots for a recipe. I also crush dry bread crumbs for a single piece of fish and herbs. This set is good for those small to slightly larger tasks. I find I am reaching for these more often than my larger one.
1,"Crazy for Breakfast Club . This movie arrived quick. Which is always a good thing. I hate when it takes forever for a movie or purchase to get to my mail box. When I bought it used I was afraid that it would come with scratches and would skip certain scenes, so I would have appreciated it if I had known if it was going to have several scratches. Other than that it has been a very good purchase and I am pleased with the product."
0,"Very Poor Design . If you own these bottles please pay close attention to the little vent holes/slits in the bottom disc. I was just washing my bottles and was horrified to realize that there was a black mold like substance in the slits. I wash them better than they recommend, I hand wash and boil all the pieces. So why is there mold forming in the slits? I'm getting rid of all these germ infested bottles and going to buy a better designed bottle. Oh...they don't prevent air bubbles any better than any other brand. Just don't waste your money on them."
0,"Never got it to work . This product was frustrating to try to use, the software didn't work, and tech support was very unhelpful, and expensive, considering you waited on hold on a non-toll-free number. I returned it and went with the ATI Radeon All-in-Wonder 7500, which I love."
0,A Major Dissapointment . I have read every single book by Karyn Monk and I have loved all of them except this one. I didn't even finish the book it was so bad. The heroine was annoying and condescending towards the hero and the hero eas just a washed-up has been. The characters just did not work for me. What happened to the magic she so aptly displayed in all of her other books? Well I guess every author writes at least one unsatisfactory book or two.
1,"a wonderful, over-looked sleeper . Although the story is about famous Z-writer/director Edward D. Wood Jr. and his many mishaps while trying to become a well-received mainstream filmmaker, the heart of the story is the touching friendship between Ed and Bela Lugosi.Excellently acted, written, directed, photographed, and scored, Tim Burton's ED WOOD is certainly the auteur's best, personal works next to VINCENT and EDWARD SCISSORHANDS: all the stories of misunderstood outsiders.Martin Landau's Oscar-Winning, scene stealing Bela Lugosi is not to be missed:PULL THE STRING! PULL THE STRING!"
1,"One of those books that's stayed with me . I read this book shortly after it came out 14 years ago, and it's stuck with me all these years. I won't say its the greatest book I've ever read - there were definately some slow points and characters that seemed to be a bit TOO odd or maybe even unnecessary - but it is definately a VERY GOOD book, one I would recommend to anyone looking for some nice escapist fiction that can get you thinking in unusual ways. It offers some very nice twists and turns and was quite and enjoyable ride. It's not every book I remember 14 years after first reading it."
0,"rubber chafes my ankles . I wore these for one day only. The rubber chafed against my ankles until my skin was rubbed off. So, don't wear these without socks. In addition, they just weren't very comfortable at all. It felt like I had a bunch of hard rubber nipples pressed against my foot (and that's pretty much what it was). I guess if you want shoes that you can spray off with the garden hose, then these will work for you. But, if you want something more comfy, try Teva, or Keen."
1,"Good, But Consider Lilly is Better . I truly enjoyed this book, but their second book is better. While I agree that I would like Emily to be a little more ""forceful"" in the book, I believe it truly depicts some of the struggles a young, Christian woman would have in NYC. I found it funny and inspiring. I would recommend it as a gift for any young, Christian woman who is going off to college or life after college. Asks some good questions, that are not always easy to answer!"
0,"Recycled and shallow... is this really Marquez ? . The protagonist of this book mentions a Latin quote: ""No old man forgets where he has hidden his treasure"" Well....in this case it seems that Marquez has forgotten exactly that: the place where he has hidden his superb skills as a narrator of fascinating, magic realistic stories.The novel is a shallow, disappointing story about a 90 years old bachelor and his love for a teenage virgin he likes to watch while she sleeps. The magic atmosphere of the small South American city which is Marquez forte in other novels feels like a strained recycled background to an unsatisfying story.Is it possible that like Salvador Dali at old age allowing young painters to imitate his style, this book was written by a ghost writer while the old master nods his head slowly in the heat of an afternoon siesta in Macombo ?"
0,"where is the personal touch? . The autor writes too much about the research subjects. She should place more attention on the conclusion and elaborate more about it with her personal experience. Certainly, her own experience also counts.The book is like a research paper, a thesis. It is not easy to read."
0,dishonest . ever wanted your intelligence assumed to be zero? ever wanted to read a bill ayers book? have nothing better to do than support a fraud? this is your book.
0,"""Wake To"" Button suddenly died. . Amazon replaced it with a second unit after the first one had issues with the ""Wake To"" button. I could not choose between iPod, Radio or Buzzer to wake up to. The second unit arrived and it worked fine for a few days and then the ""Wake To"" button stopped working again. Too bad, because the rest of the functions are OK and its sound is very nice. I ordered a full refund. What I can't complain about is Amazon's service, they are the best, they deserve 10 stars!"
0,"April Declared, ""Clinton Free Month"" by NAB . Right-wing commentators are being asked during the month of April to go five minutes or more without mentioning Bill Clinton in their ""Clinton Free Month"". Said one NAB fficial, ""Clinton left office three years ago, yet pundits like Hannity, Limbaugh, and Coulter can't go more than five minutes without mentioning his name. It seems a sort of psychological malady. We are doing this for them, to try to ween them off their weird Clinton obsession in the hopes the national dialogue improves a little."""
1,"Nice and fast ride for my sons . As described, fast but quiet, the electric motor keeps up to long hours of fun. I recommend this bike."
1,"A Barbarian's Love Story . Irony, agony, and love are the major elements in Peter Hargitai's novel, Atilla: A Barbarian's Love Story. Atilla's struggle to free himself from the shackles of the past customs is an emotional rollercoaster.His post-modern fiction would be appreciated by generations who find themselves agonized by people's rejections of the joining of multicultural societies. Some may criticize the novel for the ordinary love story, however, it's what makes it worthy to read. Peter Hargitai was anything but close-minded about the current ""melting pot"" in America, and this is what the world needs. Even if the beginning may not be in sync with the rest of the book, it's a nice sense of Hungarian history. Despite some technical errors, the overall jist of the novel is enjoyable."
1,"You can bring ""who you are"" into the work place. . Being a corporate executive I belived I had to be one person in my personal life, and yet another in my work life. This book helped me to realize that was not true. ""Work and the Human Spirit"" is a powerful example of the strenght, excitement and dedication one can find if the bring all they are into the work place. It's a must read if you find yourself expereincing the same sturggle."
0,"This guy is just bad . He wrote about 3 songs in the eighties that were alright, but he is just not good. I would not buy an entire album of his. There are much better artists out there that leave him in the dust."
1,"An Entertaining Read . I enjoy everything prison related. Not sure why, but I have a total fascination with the world of incarceration. This book was one of many that I enjoyed. Written in a simple and easy to read format it is a book that you can read in a day or two and not miss a beat. It is a good account of what life is like on the inside, or rather, what I would imagine it is like. If you enjoy a read about life on the inside, you should pick this one up. Enjoy!"
1,"great gift for girls...and boys . This little book hits the spot for preteen & older readers. It's graphically colorful, with a variety of interesting photos & illustrations; it's written conversationally, yet with enough factual citations to validate the unbelievable, heroic stories; and, it introduces the reader to a cast of amazing female characters mainly unheard of in contemporary American culture.I bought it to send to my grandchildren, but was captivated into reading it myself. I learned a lot."
1,"Nice but a bit ""watered down"" . ""Rain"" is a classic pre-censorship movie of the 30's. As usual with this type of film, one must do a fair amount of reading between the lines to get the full story. Joan Crawford gives a strong performance as Sadie Thompson, a trollop on the run from the law. Walter Huston as Alfred Davidson, a bible thumping, over the top preacher, is sufficiently scary. The rest of the cast puts in fine performances. The cinematography is also exceptionally elegant.The story is a bit watered down from it's Somerset Maugham original, and some extreme leaps of believability are needed on the part of the audience to accept the denouement. But the story is strong and powerful and surprisingly up-to-date considering it is almost 70 years old. It would seem the religious right has been throwing its muscle around longer than we think.I highly recommend ""Rain"", if for no other reason than to see Joan Crawford in the type of role that made her famous."
1,"Simply superb dance music ! . Superb! That's the only word I find to qualify this excellent compilation. Once you buy it, stop listening to it becomes impossible. The day it arrived I listened to it three times in a row. I've known only ""I like Chopin"" from the 80's, I think no other music from Gazebo has been played on radio in Brazil during all these years. I simply got astonished because all the other musics from this cd are quite so good as ""I like Chopin"". And I finally could get a original version of this classic song, both single edit and the LP version. I only had the remix version from the 90's. I really loved ""Wrap the rock"", ""Gimmick"", ""For Anita"" and ""Telephone Mama"". Although the price of 29 dollars plus shipping and the 60% tax I paid to my country's customs it was completely worthy awhile. Thanks for Amazon and Gazebo for this really enjoyable cd !"
1,"Thank God Some People Agree With ME! . I am so glad there are other people who miss Nick Fox. I was really surprised when the author decided to kill him out of the series. He and Jess were the best couple and i really wished he would have stuck around. I haven't read this book, infact i stopped reading Sweet Valley University after Your Not Sister so i really have no idea who Sam or Neil are, but i was happy when I read the reviews of other people that said the author should bring back Nick Fox."
0,"Getting Outdated . 14th edition (January 1999) is now 5 years old, so this book is woefully out of date for anyone looking for streets added or changed in the last SIX years (assuming that when a book comes out, it already a year out of date). Hey ADC, how about a new edition!!"
1,"Great Show - DVD design lacking . If your a FireFly fan buy it now. The shows are great, good sound, widescreen (Fox never showed'm that way) and lots of the plot arc of makes sense (since Fox showed them out of order so things were very strange). The only complaint is the quality of the DVD Menus and such. The graphics just have a cheap feel and the selection 'bug' disapears into the background from time to time. Not a fatal flaw, but glaring compared to the quality of the shows.The missing espisodes explain alot too - why Irna was leaving at the begining of 'Objects in Space' (my fav) and more of Mal and Zoe's history. Plus of course you get to see a real live alien (or is it.....)Enjoy"
1,"ultimate food count book . The Complete Book of Food Counts is essential to any successful healthy lifestyle. It is concise, clear and helpful in every way. I just had gastric bypass surgery and this book was recommended by my surgeon to help guide me nutritionally as I begin my new journey to eating right. This book will enable me to do that."
0,"Life is too Short for Bad Books . I'm not just being snooty ... I really didn't like ""Plan B"". The story's transparent plot is an excuse for the main character to reminisce about how wuuunderful his college girlfriend was and boo-hoo about how she dumped him and he got married on the rebound. He should have saved it for his junior high school-style diary."
1,"granddaughter pleaser . this Christmas was extra special when the pogo stick was the first to arrive. My granddaughter, who knows a whole lot more about computers than I, just thought I was the greatest because I shopped on line. Thanks, amazon for making this a terrific help when time is of the essence."
0,"Scattered . This is a terrible book. Yes, it provides you with a broad overview of the history of Christianity, but it is scattered and badly organized. It gives focus to what seem to be some random movements, events, and beliefs in the Christian history while neglecting others. It needs editing for consistency and to clarify run-on sentences and poorly illuminated points."
0,"broken stapler . This ""heavy duty"" stapler is anything but. The tab holding in the staples is a light piece of plastic that breaks off after a year or two of use. How dumb can they be making a heavy duty metal staple dependent on a crappy little plastic tab"
1,"Ciara, ""Goodies"" . I just want to say that I love Ciara's first album Goodies. She sings about real situations and has a beautiful voice. Her music is real and really applies to teens today. I rep her to the fullest!"
0,"Violets that need watering! . This story was a huge letdown! Although, I'll admit, this started out to be a page-turner. Which was fast-paced, gory, gruesome, and very intriguing. Just the way I like em, so I thought. But, it didn't seem to want to slowdown, it kept right on going and going, leaving the ending rushed and lacking drama. The story completely dies. No suspense, what so ever, not a typical Patterson novel. And, furthermore, to make things worse, in an effort to pick it back up, which, should've been another story altogether, we discover who's the Mastermind. And, that also is a disappointment."
1,"Courtship of the Vicars Daughter . Loved this story,could hardly put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting an interesting story."
0,just don't . the voice actors were all a great choice! The rest just don't put yourself through the pain of watching it just re-read the books :)
0,"Interesting Life made Less than Interesting . There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages."
0,Poor DVD playing . I bought this sylvania DVD/VCR recorder/player last year for my husband and lately all the DVD player does is scramble the DVD's
1,A not-too-sweet Success . At last a children's book that doesn't raise your blood sugar! Great illustrations and a memorable way to present the counting concept. I wish there were more books like this and the companion Mouse Paint.
0,"Worse than a bad case of diarrhea . Some time ago, I had a really bad case of diarrhea. I thought that after I flushed the toilet, it would be gone forever. Little did I know that Sarah Palin and her handlers were siphoning from the sewage pipes of Los Angeles County and repackaging it into a 'documentary.'Leni Riefenstahl couldn't have made a film with more right-wing propaganda than this piece of garbage."
1,Perfect Diversion- Beachside read! . Danielle Steele writes another diversionary read with a fun happy ever after ending! I love this kind of book for a quick mental getaway. Read it in one sitting and think of it as the perfect style writing for women who just need a quick fun pick up. Entertaining and fun to read.
0,"More of the same will NOT save us. . We consumed our way into our current mess and it is the height of folly to believe we can consume our way out of it. Privatization (read commodification)is definitely not the answer. The reason the author comes to the conclusions he does is that it is just too difficult for him to give up his current lifestyle. Showing us that recycling doesn't work is easy. Recycling is what happens when we commodify something like garbage, so let's commodify everything and that will solve our other problems just as effectively. Read 'Divided Planet' if you want a really well written book on the subject."
1,2 years and still going! . I bought this from Amazon a couple years ago. It still works great and I enjoy it very much. It is one of my favorite things. Seeing those rainbows in the early morning (I have it in an east window) brightens the beginning of the day.I would think these rainbow makers would also be great for people who are bedridden or don't get around much. Several elderly people I know have taken great delight in watching the rainbows move about their room.
1,"Enjoyable read if you can suspend disbelief . I enjoyed this book, but I still like Stephen King's The Stand better. The main reason is that the characters in Swan Song did not have enough depth. They were either ""good"" or ""bad."" I would have liked to see some of Swan's bad traits and some of Alvin's good traits, for example. Very few people, if any, are either purely good or purely evil in real life, and I felt that this is where Swan Song lacked credibility. Sometimes I actually felt like cheering for the bad guys because Swan was just too sugary sweet. Other than that, it was a decent book, worth reading."
0,"Nothing wrong with it except... . I got this and the first thing I noticed is that the usb interface was bent, like if someone did it with pliers. I fixed it with a butter knife, but I didn't like the fact that I had to do this.."
1,"Good headset for your Blackberry...but . This is a great headset for your Blackberry (I use it on my Pearl). Sound quality is good enough for music and calls and it actually makes it easier to listen to your phone calls. The microphone isn't great and picks up a lot of wind noise, unlike many of the sound canceling microphones out there.However if you live in California (and possibly other states that require hands free wireless in the car), don't cover both ears while driving as that's could result in a ticket. Either only use one earphone of the 2, or use a different headset in the car."
0,don't bother . I read the first few chapters and didn't care for this book at all. The wording was not something I cared for. I took a chance for $.99!
1,"Awsome . Great movie, even beter if you are familiar with the bible and not afraid to challange your faith."
0,"SPEED LOADER??? . I never use this ""Speed Loader"" because I find it speedier to load by hand. Probably good in a gun fight but for the range, I will use my hands."
1,Great Guide . I used this guide several times while in amsterdam recently. It was a great book to use to familiarize myself with the city and get an idea of what I was and wasnt interested in doing.The information is straight forward and useful. I recommend this book.
